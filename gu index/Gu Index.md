# $\centerline{Gu Index}$

\centerline{Gu are listed alphabetically by the path they belong to.}

## $\centerline{Blood Path}$

*Blood path Gu often cost little to feed and are easy to refine, though many recipes require slaughter at huge scales. Its attack methods are brutal, and Blood Path is considered one of the strongest offensive paths. Hundreds of thousands of inheritances were left by a Rank 7 Gu Immortal, Blood Sea Ancestor, all over the Gu world. The righteous path shuns the evil and demonic methods of blood path, and many practitioners live imprisoned in Tie clan's demon suppression tower.*

*It's worth noting that an ordinary human has about 5 liters of blood in their body.*

Health: 4

Food: <!-- TODO ->

Keywords: [**Expendable**]

Effect: Touch a Gu Master of rank {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} or less. You both have a battle of souls. If your current soul value is greater than the Gu Master's, subtract the Gu Master's current soul value from your own and you successfully permanently enslave them. You can now directly control their actions with your mind from a distance of up to (Maximum Soul) meters, as long as you can see them. They are still the same person, retaining their memories and general personality, but become wholly devoted to you, willing to do whatever you command to the highest possible standard. While directly controlling them, you can choose to take the target's turns for them; otherwise they act in whatever way they think is most helpful to you.

If the target is willing to be enslaved, they fail the battle of souls automatically and your soul takes no damage.

If your current soul value is less than or equal to the Gu Master's, you fail to enslave it, the Gu Master's current soul value is reduced by your current soul value, and then your current soul value is reduced to 1.

Your bark skin also reduces rending and force damage dealt to your hit points by 10.

At the start of each of your turns, make a **Perseverance** attribute test with a +10 penalty. On a failure, you gain a **Wood Charm Token** and your body becomes slightly more tree-like. If you ever have 10 **Wood Charm Tokens**, your body is permanently transfigured into a small tree and you die.
