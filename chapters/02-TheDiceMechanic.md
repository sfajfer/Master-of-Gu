## The Dice Mechanic

## Skill Tests
Skill tests are rolled when a character would like to do an action that:

- has a chance of failure
  
- has a chance of success

The GM should be able to determine if an action is possible for your character to do, as well as if the action should be an automatic success.

### Dice
Dice are notated d[sides]; a d4 is a four sided die. The td10 is a 10 sided die where each value is a tens place (10, 20, 30, etc). If instead of the number of dice, the die is annotated with an R (Rd12), then the number of dice is equal to the rank of the Gu. This system uses d4, d6, d8, d10, td10, d12, and d20. 

#### The d100
Skill tests are rolled on a d100; to roll a d100, roll a d10 and a td10. The td10 represents the tens place while the d10 represents the ones place. So if you roll an 80 and a 5, your roll is 85. Rolling a 10 on the d10 is just a zero, so rolling 90 and 10 would just be 90. Finally, rolling 00 on the td10 and a 10 on the d10 is 100.

### Penalties and Bonuses
Penalties and bonuses are a number added or subtracted from the number you roll on the die during a skill test. The GM can add either to represent the difficulty of the check, using the table below as a guideline. Penalties and bonuses do not have to be round multiples of 10, but they typically are.

| Penalty/Bonus | Difficulty |
| ----- | ----- |
|      +80       | Nearly Impossible (Traveling against the Reverse Flow River) |
|      +60       | Extreme Difficulty (Refining an Immortal Gu) |
|      +40       | High Difficulty (Convincing a Wisdom Path master to change their plans) |
|      +20       | Difficult (Cultivating with minor distractions) |
|       0        | Challenging (Cultivating in a secret room) |
|      -20       | Slightly Challenging (Refining a common Gu) |
|      -40       | Simple (Identifying poisonous plants around your clan's walls) |
|      -60       | Trivial (Haggling a merchant to take a few primeval stones off a large price) |

### Advantage and Disadvantage
If you have advantage on a test, roll an additional td10 and take the lower of the two. You can stack advantages as long as they come from different sources. Disadvantage works the same way, but you take the higher of the td10 rolls.

### Degrees of Success/Failure
For every 10 you roll above/below your skill value, you gain a degree of failure/success, respectively. Some skill tests, such as an opposed Deception/Insight roll, do not take degrees of success into account; they're either deceived or they aren't. Many tests, however, will have different effects based on the degrees of success or failure.

### Critical
When you roll at or under 1/10 of your skill's value (rounded down) on the die, you've landed a critical. Criticals are automatic successes, though degrees of success are still calculated like normal. Some skills have a critical success effect built into them, though the GM can always add a special additional success to any test you critically succeed.

If you score a critical with an attack roll, the attack deals double the damage it normally would.

### Fumble
Fumbles occur when 99-100 is rolled on the die for a skill test. If your skill value is above 99, you only fumble on a roll of 100 for that skill. Fumbles are an automatic failure, though degrees of failure are still calculated like normal.

### Opposed Tests
When competing with your skills against another creature, the two of you may be called to make an Opposed Test. You both roll a skill test, which can be for the same or different skills, and compare results. Critical successes beat any non-critical roll, and fumbles lose to any non-fumble roll. Then, the player with the most degrees of success or least degrees of failure wins. If they're tied for degrees of success/failure, then the lower number on the die wins. If they're still tied, the Opposed Test ends in a tie if possible. If the Opposed Test can't be tied, then the involved parties make the test again until they do not tie.
