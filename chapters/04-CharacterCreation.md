## Character Creation

In this game, you will create and play a Gu Master. Gu Masters are human beings who have awakened their aperture, a kind of extradimensional space within the stomach that can contain Gu and primeval essence. The first thing you ought to mark down is your starting rank. For first-time players, it is recommended to start at rank 1 initial stage. You, your group, and the game master should also determine if you want to follow the righteous path, living and working with a clan, or if you'd like to tread the demonic path, living free in the world with no masters. Your path can always be changed later on, as demonic Gu Masters seek safety and resources, and righteous Gu Masters grow disillusioned and yearn for freedom.

## Experience
You start with 500 experience to spend on character creation. Any experience left over afterwards is removed from the game, so that you start your first session with 0 experience. Experience can be spent to increase your Attributes and Skills, as well as to purchase talents (though talents cannot be purchased at character creation). At character creation, attributes cannot be raised above 50 and skills cannot be increased above 80.

- 1 point in any attribute costs 10 experience to increase up to 50, and 15 experience thereafter.
- 1 point in any skill (except Knowledge) costs 2 experience to increase.
- 5 points in Strength or any single Knowledge skill costs 6 experience.

## Primary Attributes
Primary attributes are a generalized measure of your body and mind. The base values of each of your skills are derived from these attributes. All Attribute scores start at 20 before you spend any experience to improve them. Improving an attribute also increases the value of all derived skills and secondary attributes.

**Agility** - Agility is used to dodge attacks, fight in close quarters, and to maneuver in the air.

**Fortitude** - Fortitude determines your Hit Points, Perseverance, and Strength.

**Cognition** - Your intelligence and reasoning skills. Used to create refinement recipes, remember information, and to fight in both close and ranged combat.

**Wisdom** - Wisdom increases your speed of cultivation, how often you succeed when refining Gu, and awareness of your surroundings.

**Attitude** - Attitude represents your understanding of human nature, relationships, and emotions. A higher attitude makes it easier to deceive and persuade others, and to know when others are deceiving you. It also is a minor factor in your Perseverance.

## Secondary Attributes
Secondary attributes either have a flat base value or are derived from your primary attributes.

### Health
You have a pool of Hit Points equal to your Fortitude. You can read about how damage, dying, and injury works in the combat chapter.

### Movement
Your Movement is the number of meters you can move in a turn. Your Movement is 4 meters + 5% of your Agility (rounded down).

### Strength
Your body's physical power. Strength is often overlooked by Gu Masters, as even rank 1 Gu can overpower the strongest of mortals. But battles are unpredictable, and when primeval essence runs dry Gu Masters may resort to a fistfight. Though this statistic is more relevant at rank 1, some Gu Masters choose to use Gu to enhance their strength and rely on their own muscles to pound their enemies into meat paste. Your Strength score begins equal to your Fortitude and affects the amount of damage you deal with attacks where your physical strength is a factor.

### Perseverance 
Your Perseverance is your ability to endure great pain and stress, and is equal to the sum of your Fortitude and 1/2 of your Attitude, rounded down. Perseverance is rolled when you hit 0 Hit Points.

### Soul
Your Soul score is a literal representation of the strength of your soul. Your starting Soul value is 10. Refining Gu, cultivating, and controlling beast groups all drain the strength of your soul, while sleeping restores it. Many Soul Path Gu also use the strength of your soul to determine their strength when activated. If your current soul ever hits 0 points, you die. When you sleep, your soul recovers 10% of its maximum (rounded down) for every hour spent sleeping. Sleeping for at least 10 hours fully rejuvenates your soul, regardless of rounding.

Your soul begins at 10, the single-man soul. Many Soul Path Gu can strengthen your soul and increase this value. Whenever your soul takes 1/2 or more of its maximum value in soul damage (rounded down) on a single turn, roll 1d6 and reduce the maximum value of your soul by that amount.

When your soul reaches strength 100, you have the ten-man soul. It has the proper strength to sustain damage; you no longer lose maximum soul when you take more than 1/2 of your souls maximum in soul damage.

When your soul reaches strength 1,000, you have the hundred-man soul. If you have not refined your soul using Gu, this is the maximum strength achievable. If your soul increases in strength above 1009 without being refined, your soul explodes and you die, with resurrection being impossible.

When your soul reaches strength 10,000, you have the thousand-man soul. This is the limit for mortal Gu Masters and cannot be raised higher.

If your current soul is less than half of its maximum, you have the *fatigued* condition.

### Luck
Players begin with 1 maximum luck point. Luck can be spent to force you or another creature to reroll a skill test directly after the roll, or to add a -50 bonus to a skill test you're making, before the roll. If you've expended a luck point on a skill test, you cannot spend another on the same skill test. You regain luck points up to your maximum at the start of each session.

### Activations
When you take the **Activate Gu** combat action, you can activate a number of Gu equal to your Activations. You have a number of Activations equal to 5% of (Wisdom + Cognition), rounding down to a minimum of 1. To make this calculation easier, consider that for every 20 score you have in both attributes, this number will increase by 1. *Shang Liu has a Cognition of 46 and a Wisdom of 37. With a total of 83 and every 20 combined score giving 1 Activation, brings his total Activations to 4.*

## Aptitude
Your Gu Master's aptitude is incredibly important to their cultivation and battle strength. A higher aptitude means greater primeval essence, meaning your Gu Master can fight for longer and cultivate quicker. Aptitude is mostly immutable, but some Gu exist to raise or even lower a Gu Master's aptitude.

Choosing your Gu Master's aptitude is a decision that will significantly shape their journey. Higher aptitudes offer undeniable advantages in cultivation speed, primeval essence, and clan support, but they come with the heavy burdens of increased clan expectations, heightened scrutiny, and potential danger. Lower aptitudes, while slower in cultivation, afford your Gu Master greater freedom, fewer obligations, and opportunities to forge their own path.

It is also worth considering the other players in your group. If one player is an A-grade aptitude and another is D-grade, your ranks will most likely diverge dramatically in the early to mid stages. This difference is not insurmountable, but it may not be enjoyable for the weaker Gu Master. It's recommended for the group to decide on 2 adjacent grades and have each player pick one of the two.

Aptitude is just an arbitrary grading of the amount of primeval essence a Gu Master's aperture can store. After choosing your aptitude, roll a d20, subtract 1 from the result, and add it to the minimum essence percentage of your grade to determine your personal maximum primeval essence.

*For example, Shang Liu chooses A-grade aptitude and rolls a 4 on his d20. Subtract 1 to get 3 and add that to the minimum of 80%. Shang Liu therefore has 83% as his maximum.*

**Grade - A:** 80%-99%
**Grade - B:** 60%-79%
**Grade - C:** 40%-59%
**Grade - D:** 20%-39%

## Attainment
Attainment is your understanding of the different Gu paths. That includes your knowledge of refining, using, and identifying Gu of the same path. You can find the different attainments in the Talents section (Chapter 2. Progression), and your character begins the game with *Fundamental* attainment in a single path.

## Starting Items
All characters start with a Gu Master robe, a Vital Gu of rank 1, and 25 primeval stones. At the GM's discretion (for price and availability) you may trade your starting primeval stones for additional rank 1 Gu.

## Lifespan
If your character reaches age 100 without using *Lifespan Gu*, they die.
