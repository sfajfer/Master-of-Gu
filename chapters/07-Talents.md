### Charger

*Cost:* 20 experience

When you take the *Sprint* combat action, you may make a single punching attack or activate a Gu with a range of *Touch* at some point during your turn. If you make a punching attack and it hits, the target is thrown backward a number of meters equal to 1% of your Strength attribute (rounded down), to a minimum of 0. Making the attack or activating a Gu with a range of *Touch* expends the remainder of your movement.

### Combat Absorption

*Cost:* 30 experience

You can multitask on absorbing primeval stones in the heat of combat. Absorbing the essence of primeval stones now costs a bonus action instead of a combat action.

*Requires Fundamental Strength Path Attainment*

You gain access to the **Flurry** combat action.

*Flurry:* For every arm you have, make two punching attacks against a creature within 1 meter. You gain a +20 penalty to **Dodge** skill tests and **Close Combat** skill tests made to parry attacks until the start of your next turn.

### Multi-Weapon Fighting

Your maximum hit points are increased by 5, and you gain a -10 bonus to all **Perseverance** attribute tests.

### Partial Artist

*Cost:* 80 experience

You've had an epiphany and internalized the idea of Painting Path. Choose a single Gu with the [**Dao**] keyword (whether you own it or not). You may be under the effects of that Gu even if its path is not compatible with the paths of your other [**Dao**] Gu. Whenever you break through a small or large realm, you may replace your chosen Gu with a different one.

### [Path] Scholar

*Cost:* 15 experience

*Requires Fundamental [Path] Attainment*

### Tough

*Cost:* 60 experience

Your base hit points are equal to twice your Fortitude.

### Reactive Flight

*Cost:* 15 experience

As a reaction to being sent *airborne*, you can activate a Gu that grants a flying speed and immediately execute a maneuver for free.

### Weapon Training

*Cost:* 15 experience

*Can be purchased up to 3 times*

When you purchase this talent, pick a class of mundane weapons (swords, spears, bows) or a single Gu.

You gain a -10 bonus on close combat and ranged attack rolls made with the chosen weapon for each time you've purchased this talent and selected that weapon.
If a Gu is very close in form to the chosen weapon, you still get this bonus. This usually includes higher ranked versions of the same Gu.

### Wrestling Techniques

*Cost:* 20 Experience

*Requires Fundamental Strength Path Attainment*

You gain a -10 bonus to **Athletics** skill tests resulting from a *Grapple* combat action. When you successfully grapple a creature, you may make a single punching attack against them as part of the *Grapple* combat action.

## Refinement Techniques

Refinement techniques are used to improve the Gu refinement process in many different ways, such as reducing the difficulty, duration, or even material cost of a refinement recipe. Only one refinement technique can be used on a recipe at a time.

## Path Attainments

It's difficult to use Gu of a path you aren't familiar with. Every character starts with *Fundamental* attainment in a single path. Oftentimes, a Gu Master that achieves master level attainment in any path gains great fame for their accomplishment, and may be contacted by other forces to refine Gu or complete difficult tasks related to the path.

You cannot purchase a path attainment unless you have purchased all previous attainments in the same path. So you cannot purchase master attainment in a path unless you also have purchased fundamantal and intermediate attainment.

### [Path] Attainment

**Fundamental**

*Cost:* 30 experience

You gain an additional bonus action that can only be used to activate a single [Path] Gu on your turn.

**Intermediate**

*Cost:* 50 experience

Your understanding of [Path] has reached a qualitative change, and you gain the following benefits:

- You gain a -20 bonus to all **Refinement** and **Knowledge (Gu)** skill tests to refine or identify [Path] Gu.
- **Deduction** skill tests made to develop killer moves gain a -10 bonus if they have a [Path] Gu in its core.

**Master**

*Cost:* 100 experience

Your understanding of [Path] reaches the apex of mortal comprehension. You gain the following benefits:

- You automatically succeed all **Refinement** and **Deduction** skill tests to refine or improve the recipe of [Path] Gu, so long as the Gu is of a lower rank than you. You still have to roll the failure die after a successful refinement.
- You gain a -30 bonus to all **Refinement** and **Knowledge (Gu)** skill tests to refine or identify [Path] Gu.
- You gain a -30 bonus to **Deduction** skill tests made to improve or create refinement recipes for [Path] Gu.
