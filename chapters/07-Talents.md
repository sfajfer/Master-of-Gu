## Talents

::: columns

### Charger

*Cost:* 20 experience

When you take the *Sprint* combat action, you may make a single punching attack or activate a Gu with a range of *Touch* at some point during your turn. If you make a punching attack and it hits, the target is thrown backward a number of meters equal to 1% of your Strength attribute (rounded down), to a minimum of 0. Making the attack or activating a Gu with a range of *Touch* expends the remainder of your movement.

Your maximum hit points are increased by 5, and you gain a -10 bonus to all **Perseverance** attribute tests.

### Partial Artist

*Cost:* 80 experience

You've had an epiphany and internalized the idea of Painting Path. Choose a single Gu with the [**Dao**] keyword (whether you own it or not). You may be under the effects of that Gu even if its path is not compatible with the paths of your other [**Dao**] Gu. Whenever you break through a small or large realm, you may replace your chosen Gu with a different one.

When you purchase this talent, pick a class of mundane weapons (swords, spears, bows) or a single Gu.

You gain a -10 bonus on close combat and ranged attack rolls made with the chosen weapon for each time you've purchased this talent and selected that weapon.
If a Gu is very close in form to the chosen weapon, you still get this bonus. This usually includes higher ranked versions of the same Gu.

## Refinement Techniques

Refinement techniques are used to improve the Gu refinement process in many different ways, such as reducing the difficulty, duration, or even material cost of a refinement recipe. Only one refinement technique can be used on a recipe at a time.

::: columns

### Batch Refinement

*Cost:* 25 experience

*Requires Intermediate Refinement Path Attainment*

You gain access to the Batch Refinement refinement technique. When you use the Batch Refinement refinement technique, you gain a +20 penalty to **Refinement** skill tests, and every cost of the recipe is quadrupled (including Gu). If you succeed the **Refinement** skill test, you produce 5 of the Gu; you must roll the failure die separately for each Gu.

### Bellows Stove

*Cost:* 15 experience

*Requires Fundamental Wind Path Attainment*

You gain access to the Bellows Stove refinement technique. When you use the Bellows Stove refinement technique, you gain a -20 bonus to **Refinement** skill tests.

### Brute Force

*Cost:* 25 experience

*Requires Master Strength Path Attainment*

You gain access to the Brute Force refinement technique. When you use the Brute Force refinement technique, you gain a -40 bonus to **Refinement** skill tests, and the failure die of the recipe is forced to be a d2. If the recipe belongs to Strength Path, the failure die is instead a d3. This refinement technique cannot be used to refine Wisdom Path Gu.

### Dice Falling Waterfall

*Cost:* 10 experience

*Requires Fundamental Luck Path Attainment*

You gain access to the Dice Falling Waterfall refinement technique. When you use the Dice Falling Waterfall refinement technique, you must roll the failure die twice and take the lower result. Upon successfully refining a Gu with this technique, you gain a luck point. This refinement technique cannot be used to refine Rule Path Gu.

### Dual Refinement

*Cost:* 20 experience

*Requires Intermediate Refinement Path Attainment*

You gain access to the Dual Refinement refinement technique. When you use the Dual Refinement refinement technique, you may refine two unique Gu at the same time. The Gu must be of the same or compatible paths (see Ch. 3, Gu) and their recipes must have the same duration. You make only one **Refinement** test, but otherwise treat the refinement as if they were two separate refinements.

### Extended Refinement

*Cost:* 10 experience

*Requires Fundamental Refinement Path Attainment*

You gain access to the Extended Refinement refinement technique. When you use the Extended Refinement refinement technique, you gain a -20 bonus to **Refinement** skill tests, and the duration of the recipe is increased by 8 hours. This refinement technique cannot be used to refine Time Path Gu.

### False Refinement

*False refinement was invented by Thieving Heaven Demon Venerable, enabling the production of counterfeit Gu.*

*Cost:* 20 experience
    
*Requires Intermediate Refinement Path Attainment*

You gain access to the False Refinement refinement technique. When you use the False Refinement refinement technique, you gain a -10 bonus to **Refinement** skill tests, and the primeval stone cost of the recipe is reduced by 75% (rounded down). When you successfully refine a Gu using the False Refinement refinement technique, the refined Gu is *counterfeit.* It cannot be activated, but otherwise appears exactly the same as the real version of the Gu. Gu used to appraise the counterfeit must be of a rank equal to or higher than your degrees of success (maximum 5) on the **Refinement** skill test in order to determine it is a fake.

### Hairy Man Heaven and Earth

*Condenses Gu from Heaven and Earth, opposed to Human Isolation Style. This technique is normally known only to Hairy Men, and takes great practice to perform.*

*Cost:* 50 experience

*Requires Master Refinement Path Attainment*

You gain access to the Hairy Man Heaven and Earth refinement technique. When you use the Hairy Man Heaven and Earth refinement technique, you gain a -30 bonus to **Refinement** skill tests, and the failure die of the recipe is increased by 2 stages (d4 -> d8, d6 -> d10...). This refinement technique cannot be used to refine Human Path Gu.

### One After Another

*Cost:* 25 experience

*Requires Fundamental Wood Path Attainment*

You gain access to the One After Another refinement technique. When you use the One After Another refinement technique, you gain a -30 bonus to **Refinement** skill tests, and the duration of the refinement is increased by 4 hours. This refinement technique can only be used to refine Wood Path Gu.

### Reduction

*Cost:* 20 experience

*Requires Intermediate Food Path Attainment*

### Research

*Cost:* 25 experience

*Requires Intermediate Wisdom Path Attainment*

You gain access to the Research refinement technique. Whenever you successfully refine a Gu using the Research refinement technique, you gain a -20 bonus on your next **Refinement** or **Deduction** test made to improve that recipe. This bonus does not stack.

### Sacrifice

*Cost:* 10 experience

*Requires Intermediate Blood Path Attainment*

You gain access to the Sacrifice refinement technique. Whenever you use the Sacrifice refinement technique, you may take any amount of damage directly to your hit points. This damage cannot be reduced or negated in any way. The primeval stone cost of the recipe is reduced by 100 * (sacrificed hit points), to a minimum of 10% of the recipe's primeval stone cost.

### Sauté
*Cost:* 15 experience

*Requires Fundemental Food Path Attainment*

You gain access to the Sauté refinement technique. When you use the Sauté refinement technique, you gain a -10 bonus to all **Refinement** tests, and increase the primeval stone cost of the recipe by 50% (rounding down). For every Gu used in the recipe, roll 1d10. If you roll a 1, that Gu is not consumed during the refinement.

### Shower

*Cost:* 15 experience

*Requires Fundamental Water Path Attainment*

You gain access to the Shower refinement technique. When you use the Shower refinement technique, you gain a -10 bonus to **Refinement** skill tests, and the duration of the recipe is reduced by 50%. This refinement technique can only be used to refine Blood, Poison, and Water Path Gu.

### Yin Yang

*Cost: 20 experience*

You gain access to the Yin Yang refinement technique. When you use the Yin Yang refinement technique, you may refine two unique Gu at the same time. Their recipes must have the same duration, and the paths of the Gu must be one of the following pairs:

- Fire and Ice Path
- Space and Time Path
- Strength and Wisdom Path
- Light and Dark Path
- Earth and Wind Path
- Luck and Information Path

 You make only one **Refinement** test, but otherwise treat the refinement as if they were two separate refinements.

## Path Attainments

It's difficult to use Gu of a path you aren't familiar with. Every character starts with *Fundamental* attainment in a single path. Oftentimes, a Gu Master that achieves master level attainment in any path gains great fame for their accomplishment, and may be contacted by other forces to refine Gu or complete difficult tasks related to the path.

You cannot purchase a path attainment unless you have purchased all previous attainments in the same path. So you cannot purchase master attainment in a path unless you also have purchased fundamantal and intermediate attainment.

### [Path] Attainment

**Fundamental**

*Cost:* 30 experience

You gain an additional bonus action that can only be used to activate a single [Path] Gu on your turn.

**Intermediate**

*Cost:* 50 experience

Your understanding of [Path] has reached a qualitative change, and you gain the following benefits:

- You gain a -20 bonus to all **Refinement** and **Knowledge (Gu)** skill tests to refine or identify [Path] Gu.
- You gain a -20 bonus to **Refinement** and **Deduction** skill tests made to improve or create refinement recipes for [Path] Gu.
- You gain a -10 bonus on **Deduction** and **Refinement** skill tests made to deduce killer moves if they have a [Path] Gu in its core.

**Master**

*Cost:* 100 experience

Your understanding of [Path] reaches the apex of mortal comprehension. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain a -40 bonus to all **Refinement** and **Knowledge (Gu)** skill tests to refine or identify [Path] Gu.
- You gain a -40 bonus to **Refinement** and **Deduction** skill tests made to improve or create refinement recipes for [Path] Gu.
