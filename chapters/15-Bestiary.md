## Beasts
There are an uncountable number of different beast species across Southern Border. Some of the more common ones are listed below. Beast statblocks are somewhat different than Gu Master statblocks. Beasts are missing several skills and attributes that they are incapable of using. As they do not have a Perseverance, when beasts reach 0 hit points they immediately die. They also do not have luck points, nor an aperture, and as such cannot activate Gu. Stronger beasts will have wild Gu worms living on or inside of them, however, and these Gu act independently, usually to assist the beast they live within. When the beast is in dire straits, however, most wild Gu will simply leave and try to escape.
