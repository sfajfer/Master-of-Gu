## Enslavement Path

Enslavement path Gu Masters are a huge asset to a clan. In battle, a single enslavement path Gu Master can be worth many other Gu Masters of the same rank, as they use Enslavement Gu to dominate the minds of beasts and even other Gu Masters to be used as a personal army. Enslavement path is an uncommon one to follow, however, as it costs a great deal of resources to maintain an army of beasts.

The unorthodox nature of enslavement path requires its own section in this book; this section will cover using Enslavement Gu, maintaining an army, and directing them on the battlefield. To follow the enslavement path, a Gu Master must have a strong soul foundation or else their results will be very limited.

### Enslavement Gu

There are two different Enslavement Gu (not to be confused with Gu of Enslavement Path):
- [Beast] Enslavement Gu exist for pretty much all wild beasts; in the Southern Border, wolves and boars are a common target, but some Gu Masters create armies of horses, monkeys, goats, and even birds. [Beast] Enslavement Gu usually cover a specific animal type; Wolf Enslavement Gu can enslave wolves, vermillion flame wolves, shark fin wolves, etc., but they cannot enslave dogs, which are of course enslaved with a Dog Enslavement Gu.
- Slavery Gu is used to enslave other humans and variant-humans.

### Controlling Your Army

#### Individuals
Commanding individual beasts is tedious and quickly drains the soul. When you individually control a creature, you take its turn for it, and take 1 damage to your soul at the end of its turn. You can choose to individually control any beast that is not part of a horde (beast kings must be individually controlled while part of a horde). If you do not take an enslaved beast's turn, it acts like a wild beast and is under the GM's command, but will usually follow what the horde is doing and never attack friendly creatures.

#### Hordes
If you have at least 100 beasts under your control, they must be separated into *Hordes*. A Horde of beasts has no minimum amount, but each must be led by the proper beast king, enslaved by you. The beast king leading the horde is the *Commander*. The maximum number of ordinary beasts in a horde is listed below:

Hundred Beast King: 100
Thousand Beast King: 1,000
Myriad Beast King: 10,000
Beast Emperor: 100,000
Mutated Beast King: 100 Mutated Beasts of the same type as the *Commander*

- Beast kings of a lower classification can be included in the horde of a greater beast king, but can only be controlled individually.

- Beasts that aren't part of a horde can only be controlled individually.

- In combat, creatures enslaved by you act directly after your turn.


As long as you have at least one beast or Gu Master under your control and within control range, you gain access to the *Direct* **Combat Action**.
### Direct (*Combat Action*)
You give up to one order to each of your hordes. At the end of your turn, you take 1d12 damage to your soul for every order given this way.

### Orders

#### Defend
The horde stays in its current position, attacking any creatures that enter their square or an adjacent square.

#### Attack
