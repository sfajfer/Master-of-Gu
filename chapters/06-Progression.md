# Chapter 2 - Progression

## Cultivating
The process of increasing your rank in small and large realms is called cultivating. To cultivate, you must meditate and will the primeval essence in your aperture to attack and weaken the aperture walls. To do so, first figure out how many portions of primeval essence will be required to break through the realm. For small realms, the amount is given by the table below. For large realms, the amount is (1000 * target rank) portions.

| Stage | Name | Aperture Wall | Wall Hit Points |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| 1       | Initial   | Light membrane | 1000 * rank |
| 2       | Middle    | Water membrane | 4000 * rank |
| 3       | Upper     | Stone membrane | 8000 * rank |
| 4       | Peak      | Crystal membrane | None |

When you're attempting to break through a small realm the walls retain any damage done by your primeval essence, thus you can slowly break through over time. For every hour you spend cultivating, you can expend a number of portions up to your aptitude plus your natural recovery, reducing the health of the aperture walls by an equivalent amount. This means that if you are at your maximum primeval essence, your primeval sea would be completely exhausted after 1 hour of cultivation at initial stage, 2 at middle stage, and 4 at upper stage.

When you're trying to break through from peak stage of a rank to the next rank, first take your primeval essence recovery rate and subtract (15 * target rank) to represent the natural recovery rate of your aperture walls. If the number you calculated is 0 or greater, you can move on to the next step. If it is negative, you'll have to increase your recovery rate via consuming primeval stones or use a Gu that assists in cultivation to break through to the next stage.

You must cultivate for 24 hours straight with no breaks in order to break through to the next rank. For every 10 essence per hour you recover greater than the natural recovery rate of your aperture walls, this time is reduced by 4 hours, to a minimum of 8 hours.

For very 4 hours spent cultivating, whether breaking through a small or large realm, make a **Cultivation** skill test with a bonus/penalty according to the table below. If you fail, your soul takes damage equal to the degrees of failure.

| Target Rank |  Modifier  |
| ----- | ----- |
|      1      |   -20   |
|      2      |   -10   |
|      3      |   none  |
|      4      |   +10   |
|      5      |   +20   |

When you successfully break through a small realm, your maximum portions of primeval essence is doubled but you retain your current number of portions. When you break through a large realm, your primeval sea is completely emptied of the previous rank's primeval essence and your maximum primeval essence is reset to your aptitude.

### Consuming Primeval Stones
You can expend primeval stones to hasten your cultivation, and you may do so to assist in breaking through both small and large realms. You may expend any number of primeval stones per hour spent cultivating, increasing your recovery rate by {5, 4, 3, 2, N/A} for each stone consumed per hour when breaking through large realms, or dealing {5, 4, 3, 2, 1} damage to the aperture walls for each stone consumed when breaking through small realms. This depends on your current rank, not the target rank. Primeval stone expenditure must remain constant each hour when breaking through large realms; you cannot use 5 stones the first few hours and then stop using stones for the remainder of the duration.

## Spending Experience
In addition to progressing through cultivation, you also get more skilled as a Gu Master as time passes. The GM will award experience at the end of each session, recommended to be between 8-12 experience. Experience earned in this way can be stockpiled, and a few Gu are even be able to consume it as a resource. At the GM's discretion, the players will be allowed to spend their accrued experience at a particular time. Typical situations to allow spending of experience are either when the party is safe and able to rest, or whenever they increase their cultivation.
