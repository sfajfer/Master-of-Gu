# Chapter 2 - Progression

## Cultivating
The process of increases your rank in small and large realms is called cultivating. To cultivate, you must meditate and will the primeval essence in your aperture to attack and weaken the aperture walls. To do so, first figure out how many portions of primeval essence will be required to break through the realm. For small realms, the amount is given by the table below. For large realms, the amount is (1000 * target rank) portions.

| Stage | Name | Aperture Wall | Wall Hit Points |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| 1       | Initial   | Light membrane | 1000 |
| 2       | Middle    | Water membrane | 3000 |
| 3       | Upper     | Stone membrane | 7500 |
| 4       | Peak      | Crystal membrane | 1000 * target rank (large realm) |

When you're attempting to break through a small realm, the walls retain any damage done by your primeval essence, thus you can slowly break through over time. If you spend an hour cultivating, you can expend as much primeval essence as you want to, permanently reducing the health of your aperture walls by the number of portions expended. 

Large realms, on the other hand, are not so easy. When you're trying to break through from peak stage of a rank to the next rank, first take your primeval essence recovery rate, add the recovery from any primeval stones you're consuming, and subtract (16 * target rank) to represent the natural recovery rate of your aperture walls.

If the number you calculated is positive, you can move on to the next step. If it is negative, you'll have to increase your recovery rate via consuming primeval stones or use a Gu that assists in cultivation to break through to the next stage.

Now, subtract however much essence you have in your aperture from the total number of portions required to break through. Divide that number by the recovery number you calculated in the previous step. This is how many hours straight you will need to cultivate to break through to the next realm. You can round this number up to the nearest hour.

*Large Realm Breakthrough Equation*
time (hours) = (wall hitpoints - current essence) / (recovery + stone recovery - wall recovery)

For each hour spent cultivating, whether breaking through a small or large realm, make a **Cultivation** test with a bonus according to the table below. If you fail, your soul takes damage equal to the degrees of failure (minimum of 1).

| Target RankÂ¹|  Bonus  |
| ----- | ----- |
|      1      |   -50   |
|      2      |   -40   |
|      3      |   -20   |
|      4      |   -10   |
|      5      |   none  |

### Consuming Primeval Stones
You can expend primeval stones while cultivating to make up for not having a high enough recovery rate, and you may do so to assist in breaking through both small and large realms. You may expend any number of primeval stones per hour spent cultivating, increasing your recovery rate for that hour by {5, 4, 3, 2, N/A} for each stone consumed when breaking through large realms, or dealing {5, 4, 3, 2, 1} damage to the aperture walls for each stone consumed when breaking through small realms. This depends on your current rank, not the target rank.

## Spending Experience
In addition to progressing through cultivation, you also get more skilled as a Gu Master as time passes. The GM will award experience at the end of each session, recommended to be between 8-12 experience. Experience earned in this way can be stockpiled, and a few Gu are even be able to consume it as a resource. At the GM's discretion, the players will be allowed to spend their accrued experience at a particular time. Typical situations to allow spending of experience are either when the party is safe and able to rest, or whenever they increase their cultivation.
