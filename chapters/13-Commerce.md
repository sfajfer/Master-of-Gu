### Refinement Recipes
Refinement recipes have a listed market value, but that doesn't necessarily mean the recipe is worth that amount. The market value assumes that this recipe is not available anywhere and there are no extenuating circumstances. But if you have a new recipe for Dog Enslavement Gu when the Three Kings Inheritance opens, the actual selling price will shoot up. Once you sell it the first time, however, the price will naturally go down somewhat. You can sell the same recipe as many times as you want, after all. Generally, the selling price is reduced by 75% every time it is sold.
