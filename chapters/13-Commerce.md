## Commerce

The marketplace breathes life into a continent dotted with tens of thousands of isolationist clans. Caravans owned by Shang Clan's many vassals travel millions of miles across Southern Border like a system of blood vessels, visiting a vast majority of the continent's clans. The caravan system disperses newly discovered Gu, beasts, and recipes into the economy, and great importance is placed on it by all Southern Border's righteous path. Robbing caravans is dangerous, and even the successful thieves are often hunted down by heroes or bounty hunters.

### Makeup of a Caravan

Caravans vary greatly in size, but the smallest generally have 200 people. Shang Clan regulations require at least one rank 3 Gu Master on every caravan, but larger caravans are guarded by a rank 4. More Gu Masters are hired, split into teams, and assigned to sections of the caravan. The rest of the caravan's population is made up of mortals and slaves, used for menial labor. Rank 1 Gu Masters are given auxillary roles, as the dangers posed to a caravan are often more than they can handle.

### Refinement Recipes

Refinement recipes have a listed market value, but that doesn't necessarily mean the recipe is worth that amount. The market value assumes that this recipe is not available anywhere and there are no extenuating circumstances. But if you have a new recipe for Dog Enslavement Gu when the Three Kings Inheritance opens, the actual selling price will shoot up. Once you sell it the first time, however, the price will naturally go down somewhat. You can sell the same recipe as many times as you want, after all. Generally, the selling price is reduced by 75% every time it is sold.

### Refinement Materials
Areas attuned with with the natural Dao generate plants, animals, stones, and other materials infused with a miniscule amount of Dao. These materials can be used to feed or refine Gu, and the areas that produce these materials are coveted by organizations and individuals. There also exist immortal refinement materials with higher amounts of Dao, but these materials are priceless compared to mortal materials and significantly rarer.
