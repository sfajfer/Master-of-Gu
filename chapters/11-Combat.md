# Chapter 4: Combat

## Initiative
At the beginning of combat, an initiative is rolled. If an enemy is within 3 meters of you, roll **Close Combat**. If not, roll **Ranged Combat**. The player with the most degrees of success goes first. In the case of ties, the lower number on the die goes first. If this is still tied, creatures controlled by a player go before non player characters. If the tied creatures are all player characters, they decide amongst themselves who goes first; if all are NPCs, the GM chooses. Continue this process for the rest of the combatants. 

### Surprise
Surprised creatures have a +20 penalty to their initiative roll and cannot take reactions until the start of their first turn.

### Stealth
There is no stealth skill in the game. Many Gu render your personal sneaking skills worthless, and so most Gu Masters that wish to walk unobserved will use concealment Gu to do so. In the case either party is not using these Gu, the creature you are trying to sneak past makes an awareness check with a penalty or bonus determined by the GM for the circumstance, including the stealthing party's measures to hide themselves.

## The Turn
One turn lasts 10 seconds. Gu Masters recover primeval essence at the beginning of each of their turns.

### Start and End of Turn Effects
If you have multiple start or end of turn effects, you choose in what order they resolve. If an effect is applied to a creature for a specified duration, say 3 turns, the number of turns remaining ticks down at the end of the creature's turns, with the effect ending if it hits 0.

### Action Economy
Gu Masters can take a **Combat Action**, two **Reactions**, a bonus action, and a movement on each of their turns.

## Movement
You can move a number of meters on your turn equal to your movement. 1 meter of movement corresponds to moving 1 adjacent square, including corners. If you have a flying speed, you may forego this movement to execute a number of *Maneuvers* dependent on the flying Gu being used.

A creature cannot move through a hostile creature's square, and cannot end their turn inside another creature's square (unless they are [**Tiny**]).

### Jumping
Jumping costs half of your movement in meters, rounded up. If your movement is 0, you cannot jump.

#### Standing Jump
From rest, you can jump a maximum of 10% of your athletics skill (rounded down to a minimum of 1) in meters upwards, or 2 meters forwards.

#### Long Jump
If you move at least 1 meter in the direction of your jump before jumping, your forward jumping distance is equal to half your movement, rounded up.

### Maneuvers
You may only execute a Maneuver if you have a flying speed. With the exception of *Take Flight*, you must be *airborne* to execute a maneuver. While *airborne*, you make **Dodge** skill tests with your **Flying** skill until you return to the ground, and use your flying speed when dodging.

#### Take Flight
Taking flight can only be done when on the ground. You rise a number of meters into the air equal to half your flying speed, rounded down, and are now *airborne*. 

#### Fly
You move a number of meters equal to your flying speed in a straight line in any direction.

#### Dive
Make a **Flying** test. On a success, you dive down a distance of up to triple your flying speed, and can move up to your flying speed in meters forward. Then, you can either try to execute a *Land* maneuver or else rise 1 meter directly upward at the end of the maneuver.

If you fail the test, you dive directly downward a number of meters equal to your flying speed before regaining control. If this would cause you to hit the ground, you do so, are no longer *airborne*, and take 1d4 force damage for every meter you dove.

#### Evade
Make a **Flying** test. On a success, all skill tests made to hit you with an attack are made with a penalty equal to +(your flying skill, rounded down to the nearest ten) until the start of your next turn.

#### Land
You land on solid ground. If executed at the end of a dive or atop *Uneven Terrain*, you must succeed a **Flying** test or else land *prone*.

### Climbing
When climbing a surface, your movement is reduced by 4. If the surface does not have easy handholds like a ladder the GM may call you to make an **Athletics** test or else fall.

### Swimming
Non-aquatic creatures consider water to be difficult terrain. A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 10% of their Fortitude attribute (rounded down) before falling unconscious. If the creature remains unable to breath for the same period of time after passing out, they die.

### Difficult Terrain
If a creature is standing in difficult terrain, it costs 2 meters of movement instead of 1 to move to another square.

### Cover
If a creature is completely hidden behind cover from the attacker, they have full cover and typically are not a viable target for attacks. If the attacker uses a Gu with the [**Piercing**] keyword, however, they can make an attack against an obscured target with a +20 penalty. Divinations that reveal the exact location of a target remove this penalty.

If a creature is only partially obscured by cover, they have partial cover; they are a viable target, but attacks made against them are made with a +10 penalty. If the attacker uses a Gu with the [**Piercing**] keyword, however, there is no penalty to the attack roll.

## Combat Actions

### Activate Gu
Your Activations can be used to activate Gu as well as to utilize the lingering effects of many Gu, such as directing manifestations. You may activate a number of Gu equal to your **Activations** attribute. You may activate each at any time during your turn, including in the middle of movement, but you cannot activate a Gu when it is not your turn. You may activate the same Gu multiple times, unless you are sustaining it. Using up your activations does not prevent you from activating Gu using your reactions.

### Activate a Killer Move
Pick a killer move for which you have all the Gu and enough primeval essence for all activations. For every activation in the killer move over your **Activations** attribute, take 1 damage to your soul. The killer move activates, applying its effect. If the killer move has the [**Sustained**] keyword, you take 1 damage to your soul any time you activate a Gu while sustaining the killer move.

### Melee Attack
Melee attacks made against a target incapable of moving automatically hit.

#### Weapon Attack
Roll a **Close Combat** skill test against an enemy within your weapon's range. On a hit, deal the damage of the weapon, +1 damage for every 20 points you have in Strength.

**Multi-Weapon Fighting**
When wielding more than 1 weapon, you can make a number of melee attacks equal to the number of wielded weapons instead of just 1. If you elect to do so, all melee attacks made have a penalty equal to +(number of attacks * 10). You cannot wield more weapons than you have arms and hands.

#### Unarmed Strike
When you make an unarmed strike, you may make a punching attack for each arm you have. Alternatively, you may kick once.

Punching Attack: Roll a **Close Combat** skill test against an enemy within 1 meter. On a hit, deal 1 force damage, +1 damage for every 10 points you have in Strength. For every 5 damage dealt, even if it is reduced, you take 1 force damage directly to your hit points. Gu such as Metal Skin Gu and Copper Tendons Gu are typically used to prevent your own strikes from hurting you.

Kick: Roll a **Close Combat** skill test against an enemy within 1 meter. On a hit, deal 1 force damage, +1 damage for every 5 points you have in Strength. The target is knocked backwards a number of meters equal to 1% of your Strength attribute (rounded down, minimum 1) and lands *prone*.

### Called Shot
When you make an attack roll against a creature, you can choose to pick a particular body part, worn or carried item, or manifested body parts like wings as the target of your attack. A called attack roll is made with a penalty based on the size of the target; for an average person, their hands would be tiny, arms and the head are small, and the torso is medium.

| Size | Modifier to Hit |
| ----- | ----- |
| Tiny | +40 |
| Small | +20 |
| Medium | 0 |
| Large | -20 |
| Huge | -40 |

### Grapple
Select an enemy of equal or lesser size in an adjacent square. Roll an opposed **Athletics** test against them. If you win, The creature is *restrained* and now occupies the same square as you while *restrained* in this way. While you are grappling a creature, you may not make kicking attacks and the number of punching attacks you can make using the **Melee Attack** action is reduced by 1. You may expend your movement to make an **Athletics** test, with a +10 penalty for every 50 kilograms the grappled target weighs. On a success, you can move up to half your movement (rounded down).

As a combat action, a grappled creature can attempt to break free, making an opposed **Athletics** test against the grappler. On a success, they break free.

### Absorb Primeval Stones
On your turn, you can absorb the essence of a number of primeval stones equal to the number of hands you have. You must have one hand free for each stone being absorbed.

For each primeval stone being absorbed, you gain 5 portions of primeval essence, and the stone is destroyed in the process, crumbling into dust.

### Hold an Action
You can choose to hold your Combat Action, specifying an action and a trigger for it to occur. When the trigger happens, you may use a reaction to take that Combat Action. If you are reacting to an opponent's actions, you must make an opposed skill test to see whose action occurs first, with the skill in question being **Close Combat** if within 3 meters of each other, or **Ranged Combat** if not. If you hold the **Activate Gu** action, you may only specify a single activation.

Triggers can be specific or broad, ranging from "when the opponent uses Fire Pellet Gu" to "when a creature makes any hostile moves".

### Sprint
Taking the sprint action triples your non-flying movement until the end of your turn.

## Reactions
You can react to most actions around you at any time other than during your turn. An exception is that you cannot react to someone activating a Gu, but you can react to them making a ranged attack with one, manifesting an object with it, or applying any other effect. If a Gu has the [**Unreactable**] keyword, you cannot use a reaction in response to its effect. You cannot use multiple reactions to the same trigger, for example, dodging and activating a shield Gu when an attack hits you.

### Activate a Shield Gu
Unless specified otherwise by the Gu, shield Gu can be activated as a reaction, including after its determined an attack has hit you, but only before the damage has been rolled.

### Dodge
The dodge reaction can be taken when its determined an attack has hit you and before the damage has been rolled. Make a **Dodge** test, opposing the opponent's attack roll if the attack required one. If you succeed, you successfully dodge the attack and take no damage. If you fail, you are hit and take the full damage of the attack.

When you succeed a Dodge test, you MUST move at least 1 meter and at most 1/2 your movement (rounded down) in any direction. If you are unable to move, you are also unable to take the dodge reaction. If 1/2 of your movement is insufficient to escape an area of effect attack, you are struck by the attack regardless.

If you use a reaction to dodge for any trigger except an attack hitting you, you immediately move at least 1 meter and at most 1/2 your movement in any direction.

Dodging provokes opportunity attacks, but they are made with disadvantage.

### Parry
The parry reaction can only be taken when its determined a melee attack has hit you and before the damage has been rolled. Make a **Close Combat** test with a +10 penalty, opposing the opponent's attack roll. If you win, you take no damage from the attack and can make your own melee attack against the opponent in turn as long as they are within your melee range. You can parry attacks made as part of the parry reaction.

### Make an Opportunity Attack
When a creature moves from inside your melee range to outside your melee range, you may make a melee attack as an attack of opportunity. If you make an unarmed attack, it may not be a kicking attack.

### Trigger a Held Action
When the trigger you specified upon holding a combat action occurs, you may take this reaction to use said action.

### Detonate Gu Worms
As a reaction or for free at any time during their turn, a Gu Master can self-detonate any Gu owned and refined by them with a single thought. The Gu Master must be conscious to do so, and can detonate as many or as few Gu as they want, from any distance. If the Gu is being suppressed, for example by the land spirit of a blessed land, the Gu Master cannot self-detonate it. Otherwise, the chosen Gu instantly die, with no other effects. If the Gu has a self-detonation ability, it does not trigger, since the Gu was not activated.

## Bonus Actions
Bonus actions are generally fast and low-effort, such as giving a creature a Gu from your aperture, opening an unlocked door, or pulling a lever.

## Damage
When you take damage, subtract that amount from your current Hit Points, to a minimum of 0. When you hit 0 Hit Points, make a **Perseverance** test. On a failure, you are *Dying*. On a success, you enter *Final Stand*.

### Damage Types

- Force: Being struck with an object or force, such as Qi; piercing attacks are included but generally have the [**Piercing**] keyword
- Rending: Being cut or slashed.
- Cold: Low temperature attacks
- Heat: Fire and heat
- Poison: Damage taken as long as you are *poisoned* by a source; reduce all poison damage dealt to a creatures hit points by 10% of their Fortitude, rounding down.
- Shock: Electricity damage.
- Sonic: Sound-based attacks that bypass many shield Gu but are quite rare and typically weak
- Direct: Direct damage can be of any damage type and, as the name suggests, deals that damage directly to a creature's hit points. If a source says it deals damage directly to a creature's hit points, the damage cannot be assigned to any active [**Shield**] Gu, but some effects may still reduce it. Damage from poison, burning, and bleeding is always direct.

If a source says you take damage to your soul, that number is subtracted from your current soul value; you take no damage to your hit points.

### Vulnerability
If a creature or object is vulnerable to a damage type, multiply any damage of that type dealt to their hit points by 2. If they have resistance, halve the damage dealt to their hit points, rounding down. If they are invulnerable to a damage type, they do not take the damage at all.

Resistance and invulnerability granted by a Gu can be reduced by Gu of higher ranks. When you take damage of that type from a Gu of higher rank than the one granting invulnerability, you instead are treated as if you had resistance. Similarly, if you only had resistance, you now do not reduce the damage dealt at all.

### Immunity
If a creature is immune to a condition, it cannot be applied to them regardless of the rank of the source.

### Instant Death
If you take an amount of damage equal to double your maximum Hit Points from a single source, you instantly die, and do not get to roll to see if you enter *Final Stand*.

### Final Stand
While in *Final Stand*, you cannot move or take combat actions or reactions other than to activate Gu or hold your action to do so. If you take any amount of damage to your hit points while in *Final Stand*, you enter the *Dying* state and fall unconscious. If you gain any Hit Points while in *Final Stand*, you are no longer in *Final Stand* and can act as normal.

### Dying
If you are *Dying*, you are unconscious. At the end of each of your turns, roll a **Perseverance** test. On a success, you gain a **Perseverance Token**. On a failure, you gain a **Predicament Token**. Critical successes and fumbles grant 2 of the respective token. When you have 3 **Perseverance Tokens**, you are no longer *Dying* and instead enter *Final Stand*, and your **Perseverance** token count resets to 0. When you have 3 **Predicament Tokens**, you die.

### Fall Damage
When falling from a height of more than 2 meters, you take 3 force damage for every meter you fell.

### Injury
When a creature takes damage to their hit points greater than or equal to half their maximum (rounded down), some damage types apply a special effect.

- Force: 

| d4 | Effect |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1 - Broken Arm | Unusable limb |
| 2 - Broken Leg | -4 movement. -4 movement. If both legs are broken, your movement is reduced to 0. |
| 3 - Internal Bleeding | *Bleeding 1* |
| 4 - Concussion | *Dazed*. Cognition reduced by 15 for 3 days. |

- Rending: *Bleeding 1*

- Cold: *Fatigued*

- Heat: *Burning*

- Shock: *Dazed*

#### Called Shot Injuries
When you make a called shot and successfully hit a specific body part, if damage is dealt to the creature's hit point they take a corresponding injury.

- Arm: Broken Limb; Unusable
- Torso: Internal Bleeding; *Bleeding 1*.
- Leg: Broken Leg; -4 movement. If both legs are broken, your movement is reduced to 0.
- Head
| d4 | Effect |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1 - Brain Damage | Maximum Soul permanently reduced by 50% (rounded down) |
| 2 - Blinded | *Blinded* until the end of their next turn |
| 3 - Hemorrhage | *Bleeding 5* |
| 4 - Concussion | *Dazed*. Cognition reduced by 15 for 3 days. |

### Natural Recovery
When you sleep, you regain 1 hit point for every hour spent sleeping.

## Status Effects

### Ablaze
A creature with the *ablaze* condition is completely engulfed in flames. An *ablaze* creature cannot have or gain the *burning* condition. If a creature with the *burning* condition gains the *ablaze* condition, the *burning* condition is removed. At the start of each of their turns, the creature takes 15 heat damage directly to their hit points. If a creature takes heat damage to their hit points on a turn from the *ablaze* condition, at the end of the turn they must succeed a **Perseverance** test or else fall unconscious. For creatures invulnerable to heat damage, consider damage dealt by the *ablaze* condition to be of the rank of the Gu that applied the *ablaze* condition, or rank 1 if the fire was natural. Being submerged in water removes the *ablaze* condition.

### Bleeding X
*Bleeding* creatures take 1 damage directly to their hit points at the start of each of their turns for every stack of *bleeding*. This damage has no type and cannot be reduced by Gu. Levels of *bleeding* can stack additively from the same or different sources. For every hit point a *bleeding* creature restores, reduce the number of *bleeding* stacks they have by 1.

### Blinded
*Blinded* creatures cannot see and have a +50 penalty to **Close Combat** and **Ranged Combat** tests. Gu that rely on vision, including divinations that augment their sight, cannot be used by a *blinded* creature.

### Burning
*Burning* creatures take 4 heat damage directly to their hit points at the start of each of their turns. When being negated by a [**Shield**] Gu, consider this damage to be of the rank of the Gu that applied the *burning* condition, or rank 1 if the fire was natural. Being submerged in water removes the *burning* condition. A creature can use their combat action to roll around on the ground, removing the *burning* condition.

### Dazed
A *dazed* creature's activations stat is reduced by 2. At the end of their turn, they lose the *dazed* condition.

### Fatigued
A *fatigued* creature's movement is reduced by 3 meters and makes all **Dodge** tests with a +20 penalty. The *fatigued* condition lasts until the creature rests for at least an hour.

### Poisoned
Poison can have any number of effects, and a creature can gain multiple instances of the *poisoned* condition so long as each is unique. 

### Prone
A *prone* creature has a +30 penalty to all skill tests. **Close Combat** tests made to hit a *prone* creature gain a -10 bonus. **Ranged Combat** tests made to hit a *prone* creature gain a +10 penalty. A creature can expend half their movement to stand up.

### Restrained
A *restrained* creature's movement is 0. A *restrained* creature automatically fails all **Dodge** and **Flying** tests.

### Stunned
A *stunned* creature cannot move or take any actions or reactions. At the end of their turn, they lose the *stunned* condition and gain the *dazed* condition.
