# Chapter 5 - Southern Border

## Culture

## Geography

### Notable Mountains

#### Wan Cheng Peak
Wan Cheng Peak is less than 10 kilometers from Tie Clan, and atop it is built the Demon Suppression Tower. Demon Suppression Tower is a prison hundreds of meters tall and houses thousands of demonic path Gu Masters. It has metal path Gu formations protecting it from attacks. Most prisoners are subdued with the rank 3 Aperture Lock Gu, but rank 4 and even rank 5 Gu Masters are suppressed through an assortment of different methods.

#### San Cha Mountain
San Cha Mountain is a collection of 3 peaks that rise into the sky like a pitchfork, with the middle mountain being the tallest. The area has some resources, and is often fought over by the Zuo and Che Clans. Unbeknownst to anyone, it is also the site of a combined inheritance belonging to three rank 5 Gu Masters, the Three Kings Inheritance. When the inheritance activates, pillars of light visible from across Southern Border shoot into the sky periodically from each peak, transporting potential inheritors from the peaks into the inheritance.

### Tie Clan
*“Our Tie clan, since it was established, had been world-renowned for our bravery, unswerving determination and our iron-cold justice. For many generations, Tie clansmen had been upholding justice and striking down on criminals, in this course, countless people have shed blood and sacrificed their lives. The youths that have died here won’t be the first and also won’t be the last."* - Tie Mu Bai, Ch. 370

Tie Clan stands as a central pillar to the Southern Border righteous path. Their investigators are deployed to solve crimes across the entire continent, and thousands of demonic path Gu Masters guilty of vicious crimes are locked up in Tie Clan's **Demon Suppression Tower** atop Wan Cheng Peak.
