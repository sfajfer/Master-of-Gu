# Chapter 5 - Southern Border

## Culture

## Geography

### Notable Mountains

#### Qing Mao Mountain
Qing Mao Mountain is the home of Gu Yue, Bai, and Xiong Clans in a delicate balance of power.

#### Wan Cheng Peak
Wan Cheng Peak is less than 10 kilometers from Tie Clan, and atop it is built the Demon Suppression Tower. Demon Suppression Tower is a prison hundreds of meters tall and houses thousands of demonic path Gu Masters. It has metal path Gu formations protecting it from attacks. Most prisoners are subdued with the rank 3 Aperture Lock Gu, but rank 4 and even rank 5 Gu Masters are suppressed through an assortment of different methods.

#### San Cha Mountain
San Cha Mountain is a collection of 3 peaks that rise into the sky like a pitchfork, with the middle mountain being the tallest. The area has some resources, and is often fought over by the Zuo and Che Clans. Unbeknownst to anyone, it is also the site of a combined inheritance belonging to three rank 5 Gu Masters, the Three Kings Inheritance. When the inheritance activates, pillars of light visible from across Southern Border shoot into the sky periodically from each peak, transporting potential inheritors from the peaks into the inheritance.

#### Shang Liang Mountain
The capital city of Shang Clan sprawls across Shang Liang Mountain, and caravans enter and exit around the clock, coming from places as far away as Central Continent. The city covers the entire surface, and an inner city is built deep inside the mountain. The inner city is restricted to those that can pay for the progressively more expensive temporary access tokens, though tokens are also given to those who work for Shang Clan or do favors for them.

### The Three Rivers

Three massive rivers flow from the Northwest of the continent towards the Southeast, where the Yellow River and Jader River flow into Eastern Sea.

#### Jade Dragon River

#### Red Dragon River

Red Dragon River has waters as red as blood, and where it meets the Yellow Dragon River a great whirlpool exists perpetually. This deep well is filled with dangerous creatures but is a great source of refinement materials.

#### Yellow Dragon River

"Sunlight shone on the land as Yellow Dragon River flowed, with a dense forest beside the river, forming an ocean of greenery." - Ch. 206

## Super Clans

Super clans have the backing of several Gu Immortals in the family. There is a gentleman's agreement between the Gu Immortals to not meddle in mortal affairs, which is mostly kept to. Their forces generally include at least one rank 5 Gu Master, up to fifty rank 4 Gu Masters, and thousands of rank 3 and below.

### Ba Clan

### Chi Clan

### Fei Clan

### Shang Clan

Shang Clan City is the bustling economic center of Southern Border. Shang Clan and their vast network of merchant tributaries dominate trade in the region, making Shang Yan Fei, the Rank 5 head of Shang Clan, immensely wealthy.

### Tie Clan
*“Our Tie clan, since it was established, had been world-renowned for our bravery, unswerving determination and our iron-cold justice. For many generations, Tie clansmen had been upholding justice and striking down on criminals, in this course, countless people have shed blood and sacrificed their lives. The youths that have died here won’t be the first and also won’t be the last."* - Tie Mu Bai, Ch. 370

Tie Clan stands as a central pillar to the Southern Border righteous path. Their investigators are deployed to solve crimes across the entire continent, and thousands of demonic path Gu Masters guilty of vicious crimes are locked up in Tie Clan's **Demon Suppression Tower** atop Wan Cheng Peak.

### Wu Clan
Wu clan is known as the top force in Southern Border, led by rank 5 Strength Path Gu Master Empress Wu Ji.
