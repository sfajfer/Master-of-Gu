## Killer Moves

When multiple Gu are combined into a single effect it is colloquially known as a killer move. Killer moves have a core of 1 or more same-ranked Gu as well as any number of supplemental Gu of lower ranks.

### Components of a Killer Move

#### Core Gu
Core Gu are the most important part of a killer move, and determine the main paths, rank, and general effect of the killer move. Looking at the Rank 4 killer move Blood Vision, shown above, It uses Rank 4 Blood Sense Gu and Rank 4 Blood Brother Gu as its core. Blood Brother Gu can turn a creature into your blood relative, and Blood Sense Gu senses the location of blood relatives nearby, so a natural effect would be to both transmute the blood of and sense nearby creatures. These are also both Blood Path Gu, and thus the killer move belongs to Blood Path as well. Finally, the Rank of the killer move is equal to the highest ranked Gu among the killer move's core.

#### Supplementary Gu
Supplementary Gu are used to amplify or mutate the effects of the core Gu. Supplementary Gu can be of a different path and even a higher rank than the core Gu, but do not change the overall rank of the killer move. A Gu with the [**Supplementary**] keyword has a specific effect when used as a supplementary Gu for a killer move. That being said, any Gu can be used as a supplementary Gu as long as you can justify its use and detail its effect on the killer move.

#### Activations
The activations stat is simply the number of Gu in the Killer Move. More complicated killer moves use many Gu and are more taxing on the user's soul. For each Gu over your Activations attribute, your soul takes 1 damage upon activation, or at the start of each of your turns when you choose to sustain a [**Sustained**] killer move.

#### Activation Cost
The combined primeval essence cost of all Gu in the recipe. This number assumes the user is of the same rank as the killer move. If the user is of a higher or lower rank, adjust the cost accordingly.

### Deducing a Killer Move
To deduce a killer move, you must have the *Fundamental [Path] Attainment* talent in the paths of all Core Gu. You should prepare the killer move with the gamemaster first, making sure both of you agree on the Gu used and the final effect. Once you have the killer move prepared, your character has to then spend time experimenting to create the killer move. This takes a 

### Activating a Killer Move
Killer moves can be activated with the **Activate a Killer Move** combat action, but can be quite taxing on the soul depending on their complexity.
