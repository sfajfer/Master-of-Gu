### Armor
Armor is seldom seen in the Gu world, except when used by mortals. Armor is heavy and lacks the defensive strength of even some Rank 1 Gu, and thus has little demand. Still, some Gu Masters will use the effects of Gu to augment their armor for better protection.

When wearing armor, you gain a penalty to your **Dodge** rolls, but can soak up a bit more damage. Armor has a damage threshold and health statistic. Any force or rending damage dealt to you is reduced by the armor's damage threshold. Any force or rending damage dealt in excess of the damage threshold is dealt both to your hit points and to the armor's hit points. If the armor reaches 0 hit points, it breaks and becomes unusable.

| Armor |  DT  |  HP  |  Dodge Penalty  |  Movement Penalty  |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| Leather Armor |  4   |  20  |       +10       |          --        |
| Iron Armor |  8   |  32  |       +30       |          -1        |
| Shield | 4 | 15 | -- | -- |

### Weapons

Most weapons used by Gu Masters are manifested by Gu, but many Gu can improve the effects of common weapons. If a weapon has a V under its "hands" attribute, it can be wielded in one or two hands, taking the former or latter damage number depending on how many you are wielding it with.

Weapons with a range longer than 2 meters are considered ranged weapons. When you attack with them, you roll **Ranged Attack** instead of **Close Combat** and do not add your strength to the damage. You make attacks with ranged weapons at disadvantage if the target is within 1 meter of you. Thrown weapons have a range of (5 + 5% of Strength) meters (rounded down).

| Weapon |  Damage  |  Range  |  Hands  | Thrown Dmg |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| Knife | 8 rending | 1 meter | 1 | 6 rending |
| Sword | 12/15 rending |  1 meter  | V | -- |
| Spear | 10/16 force |  1 meter  | V | 10 force |
| Staff | 6 force | 2 meters | 2 | -- |
| Bow | 6 force | 12 meters | 2 | -- |
