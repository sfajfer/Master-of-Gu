## Armor
Armor is seldom seen in the Gu world, except when used by mortals. Armor is heavy and lacks the defensive strength of even some Rank 1 Gu, and thus has little demand. Still, some Gu Masters will use the effects of Gu to augment their armor for better effect.

When wearing armor, you gain a penalty to your **Dodge** rolls, but can soak up a bit more damage. Armor has a damage threshold and health statistic. Any force or rending damage dealt to you is reduced by the armor's damage threshold. Any force or rending damage dealt in excess of the damage threshold is dealt both to your hit points and to the armor's hit points. If the armor reaches 0 hit points, it breaks and becomes unusable.
