## Dice & Skill Tests

- **Skill Test:** Roll d100 (td10 for tens, d10 for ones).  
  - 99 or 100 = Fumble (auto-fail).  
  - <= 1/10 of skill value = Critical (auto-success).
  - Degrees of success/failure: Every 10 above/below skill value.
- **Penalties/Bonuses:** Add/subtract from roll.  
  - +80: Nearly Impossible, 0: Challenging, -60: Trivial.
- **Advantage:** Roll extra td10, take lower tens. Stackable from different sources.

## Combat

- **Turn:** 10 seconds.  
  - Actions: 1 Combat Action, 2 Reactions, 1 Bonus Action, Movement.
- **Movement:** Move meters = movement stat. Jumping costs half movement.

## Reactions

- **Activate Shield Gu:** As reaction to being hit, before damage.
- **Dodge:** Dodge test; When you succeed a Dodge test, you MUST move at least 1 meter and at most 1/2 your movement (rounded down) in any direction. If you are unable to move, you are also unable to take the dodge reaction. If 1/2 of your movement is insufficient to escape an area of effect attack, you are struck by the attack regardless.
- **Parry:** Opposed Close Combat (+10 penalty); counterattack if successful.

- **Experience:** Earn 8–12/session; spend when safe or after cultivation.



## Gu Basics

- **Rank:** 1–5 (higher = rarer, stronger).
- **Activation Cost:** If Gu rank > user, cost ×4 per rank above. If Gu rank < user, cost = 1.
- **Feeding Threshold:** {3 days, 7 days, 30 days, 250 days, 10 years}
