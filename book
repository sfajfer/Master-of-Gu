though many recipes require slaughter at huge scales. Its attack methods
are brutal, and Blood Path is considered one of the strongest offensive
paths. Hundreds of thousands of inheritances were left by a Rank 7 Gu
Immortal, Blood Sea Ancestor, all over the Gu world. The righteous path
shuns the evil and demonic methods of blood path, and many practitioners
live imprisoned in Tie clan’s demon suppression tower.</em></p>
<p><em>It’s worth noting that an ordinary human has about 5 liters of

test. On a failure, you gain a <strong>Wood Charm Token</strong> and
your body becomes slightly more tree-like. If you ever have 10
<strong>Wood Charm Tokens</strong>, your body is permanently
transfigured into a small tree and you die.</p>
<p>As long as you have 9 or fewer <strong>Wood Charm Tokens</strong>,
every month you go without activating Wood Charm Gu reduces the number
of <strong>Wood Charm Tokens</strong> you have by 1.</p>

<h1 id="the-system">The System</h1>
<p>This system is based on the world of the xianxia novel Reverend
Insanity (aka Master of Gu) by Gu Zhen Ren. In short, it is a high-magic
system where most characters and all players are spellcasters called Gu
Masters. Spells are contained within creatures called Gu, which can be
stored inside a Gu Master’s body. Each Gu has a specific function, and
the way your character will play is going to constantly change as your
personal collection of Gu changes. If you specialize in fire path and
later decide you’d rather beat your enemies to death with strength path,
you can sell your Gu and buy, find, or create new ones to fulfill that
purpose, or dual cultivate the paths for a unique playstyle.</p>
<h2 id="the-aperture">The Aperture</h2>
<p>The aperture is a sort of extra-dimensional space located in a Gu
Master’s stomach. Around the age of puberty, people can awaken their
aperture by coming into contact with Hope Gu. Not everyone is lucky
enough to be able to awaken their aperture, but those that do are
henceforth called Gu Masters. People without an awakened aperture are
called mortals, and are just regular people.</p>
<p>The aperture is a simple sphere bounded by walls and filled with a
sea of primeval essence, a resource used to activate Gu as well as to
cultivate. Cultivation consists of attacking your aperture walls with
this primeval essence, eventually breaking them and moving on to a new
realm. Gu Masters begin at rank 1 and can cultivate to rank 5. Each rank
is considered a large realm, and are subdivided into 4 small realms:
initial stage, middle stage, upper stage, and peak stage. After rank 5,
there are still ranks 6 through 9, but that is the realm of Gu Immortals
and the rules change massively. In this system, the maximum rank
attainable is rank 5 peak stage.</p>
<p>You can store Gu in your aperture no matter their size, and there is
no limit to the number of Gu that can be stored in your aperture.</p>
<h2 id="primeval-essence">Primeval Essence</h2>
<p>Primeval essence is the main resource used by Gu masters to activate
and refine Gu as well as cultivate to increase their strength. The
representation of primeval essence you see here is an approximation, as
the resource quickly becomes quite complex when factoring in the rank
and realm of the user alongside the rank of the Gu.</p>
<p>A Gu Master’s aperture has a maximum amount of primeval essence,
determined by their aptitude. At the initial stage of each rank, a Gu
Master has a number of portions of primeval essence equal to their
aptitude. A Gu Master at rank 2 initial stage with a 30% aptitude
(D-Grade) has a maximum of 30 portions of primeval essence.</p>
<p>When out of combat, the recovery rate is 10% of the Gu Master’s
maximum primeval essence every hour. Each small realm above initial
stage doubles the maximum number of portions available.</p>
<p>At higher ranks, your primeval essence is significantly more potent
than even peak stage of the rank below you. For simplicity, activating
any Gu of a rank below your own costs a single portion of primeval
essence.</p>
<p>As a bonus action, you may leak the aura of your primeval essence.
Any creature within 10 meters of you can sense this aura and immediately
identify the rank and stage of your primeval essence.</p>
<h2 id="primeval-stones">Primeval Stones</h2>
<p><img src="Primeval_Stone.png" /></p>
<p>Small, smooth stones naturally formed from primeval essence, primeval
stones are the main currency in the Gu world. On your turn, you can
absorb the essence of a number of primeval stones equal to the amount of
hands you have as a <strong>Combat Action</strong> . You must have one
hand free for each stone being absorbed.</p>
<p>For each primeval stone being absorbed, you gain 5 portions of
primeval essence, and the stone is destroyed in the process, crumbling
into dust.</p>
<h2 id="refinement">Refinement</h2>
<p>Gu can be created out of materials and other Gu in a process called
refinement. See the <em>Gu</em> chapter for more details.</p>
<h1 id="the-world">The World</h1>
<p>The Gu world is a massive, flat disc, consisting of 5 regions. The
source material is pretty inconsistent with size, but it is safe to say
each region is at least 6 or 7 times the surface area of the Earth. The
5 regions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Northern Plains: Flat grassland dotted with nomadic tribes of
various sizes. Conflict is commonplace and the Gu Masters here are the
most adept at fighting.</li>
<li>Western Desert: A dry wasteland with cities gathered around its
oases. Lone cultivators are very uncommon.</li>
<li>Southern Border: An uneven, mountainous region with familial clans
settling on mountainsides. The setting of this system.</li>
<li>Eastern Sea: Vast ocean dotted with archipelagos. Conflict is less
common due to difficulty in reaching other settlements, allowing its
inhabitants to focus on cultivation and gaining wealth. Many lone
cultivators.</li>
<li>Central Continent: The most powerful of the five regions and home to
the Heavenly Court. Has a mix of the other four regions’ geography
(i.e. a normal continent).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the world is a disc, Southern Border does not border Northern
Plains, but it does border the other regions. The same goes for the
other outer regions, with only Central Continent connecting to all of
them.</p>
<h2 id="mortals">Mortals</h2>
<p>People without an awakened aperture cannot use Gu. Their status is
very low, and in most places a Gu Master can outright kill any mortals
that disrespect them. Despite that, mortals do a great deal of work to
provide food and resources to the clan, and cannot be wantonly murdered
without reproach from righteous path forces.</p>
<h2 id="righteous-and-demonic">Righteous and Demonic</h2>
<p>Gu Masters identify as part of either the demonic path or righteous
path. Demonic does not necessarily mean evil, just that the Gu Master
does not follow the rigid systems of community. Of course, many demonic
path Gu Masters ARE evil and more than willing to hurt the innocent to
further their own goals. Similarly, righteous path Gu Masters are not
necessarily good, they just follow the rules of society. While many have
ideals of justice and virtue, the more powerful righteous path Gu
Masters exploit this societal responsibility for their own gain, and are
often willing to commit evil deeds to further their goals, just in more
subtle ways than the demonic path.</p>
<h2 id="setting">Setting</h2>
<p>Given the size of the world and the fact that each region has its own
local gu, flora, and fauna, I’ve chosen to localize this system to the
Southern Border. You can certainly design a campaign in one of the other
regions using this system as a framework, but there might be a great
deal of work involved. If you’re familiar with Reverend Insanity, this
system is set during Fang Yuan’s first life so as to give myself the
most source material to work with for the setting. I suppose if you play
for 500 in-game years the timeline would reset, but you can always just
ignore that and pretend Fang Yuan died before going back in time.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 is dedicated to Southern Border, its clans, and geography.
It is heavily recommended for the Game Master to read it.</p>
<p>When multiple Gu are combined into a single effect it is colloquially
known as a killer move. Killer moves have a core of 1 or more
same-ranked Gu as well as any number of supplemental Gu of lower
ranks.</p>
<p>Blood Vision <em>Rank 4 Divination Killer Move</em> Core Gu: Rank 4
Blood Sense Gu, Rank 4 Blood Brother Gu Supplementary Gu: Rank 3 Hundred
Meter Gu x 2, Total Activations: 4 Activation Cost: 49 portions
Keywords: [<strong>Sustained</strong>]</p>
<p>Effect: Any creatures within 100 meters have their blood tainted with
yours. For 24 hours, these creatures are considered your siblings by
blood path methods. While this killer move is sustained, you can sense
the exact location of any of your blood relatives within 100 meters.</p>
<h2 id="components-of-a-killer-move">Components of a Killer Move</h2>
<h3 id="core-gu">Core Gu</h3>
<p>Core Gu are the most important part of a killer move, and determine
the main paths, rank, and general effect of the killer move. Looking at
the Rank 4 killer move Blood Vision, shown above, It uses Rank 4 Blood
Sense Gu and Rank 4 Blood Brother Gu as its core. Blood Brother Gu can
turn a creature into your blood relative, and Blood Sense Gu senses the
location of blood relatives nearby, so a natural effect would be to both
transmute the blood of and sense nearby creatures. These are also both
Blood Path Gu, and thus the killer move belongs to Blood Path as well.
Finally, the Rank of the killer move is equal to the highest ranked Gu
among the killer move’s core.</p>
<h3 id="supplementary-gu">Supplementary Gu</h3>
<p>Supplementary Gu are used to amplify or mutate the effects of the
core Gu. Supplementary Gu can be of a different path and even a higher
rank than the core Gu, but do not change the overall rank of the killer
move. A Gu with the [<strong>Supplementary</strong>] keyword has a
specific effect when used as a supplementary Gu for a killer move. That
being said, any Gu can be used as a supplementary Gu as long as you can
justify its use and detail its effect on the killer move.</p>
<h3 id="activations">Activations</h3>
<p>The activations stat is simply the number of Gu in the Killer Move.
More complicated killer moves use many Gu and are more taxing on the
user’s soul. For each Gu over your Activations attribute, your soul
takes 1 damage upon activation, or at the start of each of your turns
when you choose to sustain a [<strong>Sustained</strong>] killer
move.</p>
<h3 id="activation-cost">Activation Cost</h3>
<p>The combined primeval essence cost of all Gu in the recipe. This
number assumes the user is of the same rank as the killer move. If the
user is of a higher or lower rank, adjust the cost accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="deducing-a-killer-move">Deducing a Killer Move</h2>
<p>To deduce a killer move, you must have the <em>Fundamental [Path]
Attainment</em> talent in the paths of all Core Gu. You should prepare
the killer move with the gamemaster first, making sure both of you agree
on the Gu used and the final effect. Once you have the killer move
prepared, your character has to then spend time experimenting to create
the killer move. This takes a</p>
<h2 id="activating-a-killer-move">Activating a Killer Move</h2>
<p>Killer moves can be activated with the <strong>Activate a Killer
Move</strong> combat action, but can be quite taxing on the soul
depending on their complexity.</p>
<h3 id="initiative">Initiative</h3>
<p>At the beginning of combat, an initiative is rolled. If an enemy is
within 3 meters of you, roll <strong>Close Combat</strong>. If not, roll
<strong>Ranged Combat</strong>. The player with the most degrees of
success goes first. In the case of ties, the lower number on the die
goes first. If this is still tied, creatures controlled by a player go
before non player characters. If the tied creatures are all player
characters, they decide amongst themselves who goes first; if all are
NPCs, the GM chooses. Continue this process for the rest of the
combatants.</p>
<h2 id="surprise">Surprise</h2>
<p>Surprised creatures have a +20 penalty to their initiative roll and
cannot take reactions until the start of their first turn.</p>
<h3 id="stealth">Stealth</h3>
<p>There is no stealth skill in the game. Many Gu render your personal
sneaking skills worthless, and so most Gu Masters that wish to walk
unobserved will use concealment Gu to do so. In the case either party is
not using these Gu, the creature you are trying to sneak past makes an
awareness check with a penalty or bonus determined by the GM for the
circumstance, including the stealthing party’s measures to hide
themselves.</p>
<h1 id="the-turn">The Turn</h1>
<p>One turn lasts 10 seconds. Gu Masters recover primeval essence at the
beginning of each of their turns.</p>
<h3 id="start-and-end-of-turn-effects">Start and End of Turn
Effects</h3>
<p>If you have multiple start or end of turn effects, you choose in what
order they resolve. If an effect is applied to a creature for a
specified duration, say 3 turns, the number of turns remaining ticks
down at the end of the creature’s turns, with the effect ending if it
hits 0.</p>
<h3 id="action-economy">Action Economy</h3>
<p>Gu Masters can take a <strong>Combat Action</strong>, two
<strong>Reactions</strong>, a bonus action, and a movement on each of
their turns.</p>
<h2 id="movement">Movement</h2>
<p>You can move a number of meters on your turn equal to your movement.
1 meter of movement corresponds to moving 1 adjacent square, including
corners. If you have a flying speed, you may forego this movement to
execute a number of <em>Maneuvers</em> dependent on the flying Gu being
used.</p>
<p>A creature cannot move through a hostile creature’s square, and
cannot end their turn inside another creature’s square (unless they are
[<strong>Tiny</strong>]).</p>
<h3 id="jumping">Jumping</h3>
<p>Jumping costs half of your movement in meters, rounded up. If your
movement is 0, you cannot jump.</p>
<h4 id="standing-jump">Standing Jump</h4>
<p>From rest, you can jump a maximum of 10% of your athletics skill
(rounded down to a minimum of 1) in meters upwards, or 2 meters
forwards.</p>
<h4 id="long-jump">Long Jump</h4>
<p>If you move at least 1 meter in the direction of your jump before
jumping, your forward jumping distance is equal to the remainder of your
movement.</p>
<h3 id="maneuvers">Maneuvers</h3>
<p>You may only execute a Maneuver if you have a flying speed. With the
exception of <em>Take Flight</em>, you must be <em>airborne</em> to
execute a maneuver. While <em>airborne</em>, you make
<strong>Dodge</strong> skill tests with your <strong>Flying</strong>
skill until you return to the ground, and use your flying speed when
dodging.</p>
<h4 id="take-flight">Take Flight</h4>
<p>Taking flight can only be done when on the ground. You rise a number
of meters into the air equal to half your flying speed, rounded down,
and are now <em>airborne</em>.</p>
<h4 id="fly">Fly</h4>
<p>You move a number of meters equal to your flying speed in a straight
line in any direction.</p>
<h4 id="dive">Dive</h4>
<p>Make a <strong>Flying</strong> test. On a success, you dive down a
distance of up to triple your flying speed, and can move up to your
flying speed in meters forward. Then, you can either try to execute a
<em>Land</em> maneuver or else rise 1 meter directly upward at the end
of the maneuver.</p>
<p>If you fail the test, you dive directly downward a number of meters
equal to your flying speed before regaining control. If this would cause
you to hit the ground, you do so, are no longer <em>airborne</em>, and
take 1d4 force damage for every meter you dove.</p>
<h4 id="evade">Evade</h4>
<p>Make a <strong>Flying</strong> test. On a success, all skill tests
made to hit you with an attack are made with a penalty equal to +(your
flying skill, rounded down to the nearest ten) until the start of your
next turn.</p>
<h4 id="land">Land</h4>
<p>You land on solid ground. If executed at the end of a dive or atop
<em>Uneven Terrain</em>, you must succeed a <strong>Flying</strong> test
or else land <em>prone</em>.</p>
<h3 id="climbing">Climbing</h3>
<p>When climbing a surface, your movement is reduced by 4. If the
surface does not have easy handholds like a ladder the GM may call you
to make an <strong>Athletics</strong> test or else fall.</p>
<h3 id="cover">Cover</h3>
<p>If a creature is totally obscured by cover from the attacker, they
are typically not a viable target for their attacks. If the attacker
uses a Gu with the [<strong>Piercing</strong>] keyword, however, they
can make an attack against an obscured target with a +20 penalty.</p>
<p>If a creature is only partially obscured by cover, they are a viable
target but attacks made against them are made with a +10 penalty.</p>
<h2 id="combat-actions">Combat Actions</h2>
<h3 id="use-activations">Use Activations</h3>
<p>Your Activations can be used to activate Gu as well as to utilize the
lingering effects of many Gu, such as directing manifestations. You may
activate a number of Gu equal to your <strong>Activations</strong>
attribute. You may activate each at any time during your turn, including
in the middle of movement, but you cannot activate a Gu when it is not
your turn. You may activate the same Gu multiple times, unless you are
sustaining it. Using up your activations does not prevent you from
activating Gu using one of your reactions.</p>
<h3 id="activate-a-killer-move">Activate a Killer Move</h3>
<p>Pick a killer move for which you have all the Gu and enough primeval
essence for all activations. For every activation in the killer move
over your <strong>Activations</strong> attribute, take 1 damage to your
soul. The killer move activates, applying its effect. If the killer move
has the [<strong>Sustained</strong>] keyword, you take 1 damage to your
soul any time you activate a Gu while also sustaining the killer
move.</p>
<h3 id="melee-attack">Melee Attack</h3>
<p>Melee attacks made against a target incapable of moving automatically
succeed.</p>
<h4 id="weapon-attack">Weapon Attack</h4>
<p>Roll a <strong>Close Combat</strong> skill test against an enemy
within your weapon’s range. On a hit, deal the damage of the weapon, +1
damage for every 20 points you have in Strength.</p>
<h4 id="unarmed-strike">Unarmed Strike</h4>
<p>When you make an unarmed strike, you may make a number of punching
attacks equal to the number of arms you have. Alternatively, you may
kick once.</p>
<p>Punching Attack: Roll a <strong>Close Combat</strong> skill test
against an enemy within 1 meter. On a hit, deal 1 force damage, +1
damage for every 10 points you have in Strength. For every 5 damage
dealt, even if it is reduced, you take 1 force damage directly to your
hit points. Gu such as Metal Skin Gu and Copper Tendons Gu are typically
used to prevent your own strikes from hurting you.</p>
<p>Kick: Roll a <strong>Close Combat</strong> skill test against an
enemy within 1 meter. On a hit, deal 1 force damage, +1 damage for every
5 points you have in Strength. The target is knocked backwards a number
of meters equal to 10% of your Strength attribute (rounded down, minimum
1).</p>
<h3 id="grapple">Grapple</h3>
<p>Select an enemy of equal or lesser size in an adjacent square. Roll
an opposed <strong>Athletics</strong> test against them. If you win, The
creature is <em>restrained</em> and now occupies the same square as you
while <em>restrained</em> in this way. Whenever you move, make an
<strong>Athletics</strong> test with a +10 penalty for every 50
kilograms the grappled target weighs. On a success, you can move half
your movement (rounded down).</p>
<p>As a combat action, a grappled creature can attempt to break free,
making an opposed <strong>Athletics</strong> test against the grappler.
On a success, they break free.</p>
<h4 id="multi-weapon-fighting">Multi-Weapon Fighting</h4>
<p>When wielding more than 1 weapon, you can make a number of melee
attacks equal to the number of wielded weapons instead of just 1. If you
elect to do so, all melee attacks made have a penalty equal to +(number
of attacks * 10). You cannot wield more weapons than you have arms and
hands.</p>
<h3 id="absorb-primeval-stones">Absorb Primeval Stones</h3>
<p>On your turn, you can absorb the essence of a number of primeval
stones equal to the number of hands you have. You must have one hand
free for each stone being absorbed.</p>
<p>For each primeval stone being absorbed, you gain 5 portions of
primeval essence, and the stone is destroyed in the process, crumbling
into dust.</p>
<h3 id="hold-an-action">Hold an Action</h3>
<p>You can choose to hold your Combat Action, specifying an action and a
trigger for it to occur. When the trigger happens, you may use a
reaction to take that Combat Action. If you are reacting to an
opponent’s actions, you must make an opposed skill test to see whose
action occurs first, with the skill in question being <strong>Close
Combat</strong> if within 3 meters of each other, or <strong>Ranged
Combat</strong> if not. If you hold the <strong>Use Activations</strong>
action, you may only specify a single activation.</p>
<p>Triggers can be specific or broad, ranging from “when the opponent
uses Fire Pellet Gu” to “when a creature makes any hostile moves”.</p>
<h3 id="sprint">Sprint</h3>
<p>Taking the sprint action triples your non-flying movement until the
end of your turn.</p>
<h2 id="reactions">Reactions</h2>
<p>You can react to most actions around you at any time other than
during your turn. An exception is that you cannot react to someone
activating a Gu, but you can react to them making a ranged attack with
one, manifesting an object with it, or applying any other effect. If a
Gu has the [<strong>Unreactable</strong>] keyword, you cannot use a
reaction in response to its effect. You cannot use multiple reactions to
the same trigger, for example, dodging and activating a shield Gu when
an attack hits you.</p>
<h3 id="activate-a-shield-gu">Activate a Shield Gu</h3>
<p>Unless specified otherwise by the Gu, shield Gu can be activated as a
reaction, including after its determined an attack has hit you, but only
before the damage has been rolled.</p>
<h3 id="dodge">Dodge</h3>
<p>The dodge reaction can only be taken when its determined an attack
has hit you and before the damage has been rolled. Make a
<strong>Dodge</strong> test opposing the opponent’s attack roll. If you
win, you successfully dodge the attack and take no damage. If you lose,
you are hit and take the full damage of the attack.</p>
<p>When you succeed a Dodge test, you MUST move at least 1 meter and at
most 1/2 your movement (rounded down) in any direction. If you are
unable to move, you are also unable to take the dodge reaction. If 1/2
of your movement is insufficient to escape an area of effect attack, you
are struck by the attack regardless.</p>
<h3 id="parry">Parry</h3>
<p>The parry reaction can only be taken when its determined a melee
attack has hit you and before the damage has been rolled. Make a
<strong>Close Combat</strong> test with a +10 penalty, opposing the
opponent’s attack roll. If you win, you take no damage from the attack
and can make your own melee attack against the opponent in turn as long
as they are within your melee range. You can parry attacks made as part
of the parry reaction.</p>
<h3 id="make-an-opportunity-attack">Make an Opportunity Attack</h3>
<p>When a creature moves from inside your melee range to outside your
melee range, you may make a melee attack as an attack of opportunity. If
you make an unarmed attack, it may not be a kicking attack.</p>
<h3 id="trigger-a-held-action">Trigger a Held Action</h3>
<p>When the trigger you specified upon holding a combat action occurs,
you may take this reaction to use said action.</p>
<h3 id="detonate-gu-worms">Detonate Gu Worms</h3>
<p>As a reaction or for free at any time during their turn, a Gu Master
can self-detonate any Gu owned and refined by them with a single
thought. The Gu Master must be conscious to do so, and can detonate as
many or as few Gu as they want, from any distance. If the Gu is being
suppressed, for example by the land spirit of a blessed land, the Gu
Master cannot self-detonate it. Otherwise, the chosen Gu instantly die,
with no other effects. If the Gu has a self-detonation ability, it does
not trigger, since the Gu was not activated.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-actions">Bonus Actions</h2>
<p>Bonus actions are generally fast and low-effort, such as
stowing/taking a Gu from your aperture, opening an unlocked door, or
pulling a lever.</p>
<h1 id="damage">Damage</h1>
<p>When you take damage, subtract that amount from your current Hit
Points, to a minimum of 0. When you hit 0 Hit Points, make a
<strong>Perseverance</strong> test. On a failure, you are
<em>Dying</em>. On a success, you enter <em>Final Stand</em>.</p>
<h3 id="damage-types">Damage Types</h3>
<ul>
<li>Force: Being struck with an object or force, such as Qi; piercing
attacks are included but generally have the [<strong>Piercing</strong>]
keyword</li>
<li>Rending: Being cut or slashed.</li>
<li>Cold: Low temperature attacks</li>
<li>Heat: Fire and heat</li>
<li>Poison: Damage taken as long as you are <em>poisoned</em> by a
source; reduce all poison damage dealt to a creatures hit points by 10%
of their Fortitude, rounding down.</li>
<li>Shock: Electricity damage.</li>
<li>Sonic: Sound-based attacks that bypass many shield Gu but are quite
rare and typically weak</li>
<li>Direct: Direct damage can be of any damage type and, as the name
suggests, deals that damage directly to a creature’s hit points. If a
source says it deals damage directly to a creature’s hit points, the
damage cannot be assigned to any active [<strong>Shield</strong>] Gu,
but some effects may still reduce it. Damage from poison, burning, and
bleeding is always direct.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a source says you take damage to your soul, that number is
subtracted from your current soul value; you take no damage to your hit
points.</p>
<h3 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h3>
<p>If a creature or object is vulnerable to a damage type, multiply any
damage of that type dealt to their hit points by 2. If they have
resistance, halve the damage dealt to their hit points, rounding down.
If they are invulnerable to a damage type, they do not take the damage
at all.</p>
<p>Resistance and invulnerability granted by a Gu can be ignored by Gu
of higher ranks. When you take damage of that type from a Gu of higher
rank than the one granting invulnerability, you instead are treated as
if you had resistance. Similarly, if you only had resistance, you now do
not reduce the damage dealt at all.</p>
<h3 id="instant-death">Instant Death</h3>
<p>If you take an amount of damage equal to double your maximum Hit
Points from a single source, you instantly die, and do not get to roll
to see if you enter <em>Final Stand</em>.</p>
<h3 id="final-stand">Final Stand</h3>
<p>While in <em>Final Stand</em>, you cannot move or take combat actions
or reactions other than to activate Gu or hold your action to do so. If
you take any amount of damage to your hit points while in <em>Final
Stand</em>, you enter the <em>Dying</em> state and fall unconscious. If
you gain any Hit Points while in <em>Final Stand</em>, you are no longer
in <em>Final Stand</em> and can act as normal.</p>
<h3 id="dying">Dying</h3>
<p>If you are <em>Dying</em>, you are unconscious. At the end of each of
your turns, roll a <strong>Perseverance</strong> test. On a success, you
gain a <strong>Perseverance Token</strong>. On a failure, you gain a
<strong>Predicament Token</strong>. Critical successes and fumbles grant
2 of the respective token. When you have 3 <strong>Perseverance
Tokens</strong>, you are no longer <em>Dying</em> and instead enter
<em>Final Stand</em>, and your <strong>Perseverance</strong> token count
resets to 0. When you have 3 <strong>Predicament Tokens</strong>, you
die.</p>
<h3 id="fall-damage">Fall Damage</h3>
<p>When falling from a height of more than 2 meters, you take 3 force
damage for every meter you fell.</p>
<h3 id="injury">Injury</h3>
<p>When a creature takes damage to their hit points greater than or
equal to half their maximum (rounded down), some damage types apply a
special effect.</p>

<p>A creature with the <em>ablaze</em> condition is completely engulfed

creature takes heat damage to their hit points on a turn from the
<em>ablaze</em> condition, at the end of the turn they must succeed a
<strong>Perseverance</strong> test or else fall unconscious. For
creatures invulnerable to heat damage, consider damage dealt by the
<em>ablaze</em> condition to be of the rank of the Gu that applied the
<em>ablaze</em> condition, or rank 1 if the fire was natural. Being
submerged in water removes the <em>ablaze</em> condition.</p>
<h3 id="bleeding-x">Bleeding X</h3>
<p><em>Bleeding</em> creatures take 1 damage directly to their hit
points at the start of each of their turns for every stack of
<em>bleeding</em>. This damage has no type and cannot be reduced by Gu.
Levels of <em>bleeding</em> can stack additively from the same or
different sources. Remove 1 <em>bleeding</em> stack for every hitpoint
you restore.</p>
<h3 id="blinded">Blinded</h3>
<p><em>Blinded</em> creatures cannot see and have a +50 penalty to
<strong>Close Combat</strong> and <strong>Ranged Combat</strong> tests.
Divination Gu that rely on vision cannot be used by a <em>blinded</em>
creature.</p>
<h3 id="burning">Burning</h3>
<p><em>Burning</em> creatures take 4 heat damage directly to their hit
points at the start of each of their turns. When being negated by a
[<strong>Shield</strong>] Gu, consider this damage to be of the rank of
the Gu that applied the <em>burning</em> condition, or rank 1 if the
fire was natural. Being submerged in water removes the <em>burning</em>
condition. A creature can use their combat action to roll around on the
ground, removing the <em>burning</em> condition.</p>
<h3 id="dazed">Dazed</h3>
<p>A <em>dazed</em> creature’s activations stat is reduced by 2. At the
end of their turn, they lose the <em>dazed</em> condition.</p>
<h3 id="fatigued">Fatigued</h3>
<p>A <em>fatigued</em> creature’s movement is reduced by 3 meters and
makes all <strong>Dodge</strong> tests with a +20 penalty. The
<em>fatigued</em> condition lasts until the creature rests for at least
an hour.</p>
<h3 id="poisoned">Poisoned</h3>
<p>Poison can have any number of effects, and a creature can gain
multiple instances of the <em>poisoned</em> condition so long as each is
unique.</p>
<h3 id="prone">Prone</h3>
<p>A <em>prone</em> creature has a +30 penalty to all skill tests.
<strong>Close Combat</strong> tests made to hit a <em>prone</em>
creature gain a -10 bonus. <strong>Ranged Combat</strong> tests made to
hit a <em>prone</em> creature gain a +10 penalty. A creature can expend
half their movement to stand up.</p>
<h3 id="restrained">Restrained</h3>
<p>A <em>restrained</em> creature’s movement is 0. A <em>restrained</em>
creature automatically fails all <strong>Dodge</strong> and
<strong>Flying</strong> tests.</p>
<h3 id="stunned">Stunned</h3>
<p>A <em>stunned</em> creature cannot move or take any actions or
reactions. At the end of their turn, they lose the <em>stunned</em>
condition and gain the <em>dazed</em> condition.</p>

<p>Wan Cheng Peak is less than 10 kilometers from Tie Clan, and atop it
is built the Demon Suppression Tower. Demon Suppression Tower is a
prison hundreds of meters tall and houses thousands of demonic path Gu
Masters. It has metal path Gu formations protecting it from attacks.
Most prisoners are subdued with the rank 3 Aperture Lock Gu, but rank 4
and even rank 5 Gu Masters are suppressed through an assortment of
different methods.</p>

down on criminals, in this course, countless people have shed blood and
sacrificed their lives. The youths that have died here won’t be the
first and also won’t be the last.”</em> - Tie Mu Bai, Ch. 370</p>
<p>Tie Clan stands as a central pillar to the Southern Border righteous
path. Their investigators are deployed to solve crimes across the entire
continent, and thousands of demonic path Gu Masters guilty of vicious
crimes are locked up in Tie Clan’s <strong>Demon Suppression
Tower</strong> atop Wan Cheng Peak.</p>

<h2 id="beasts">Beasts</h2>
<p>There are an uncountable number of different beast species across
Southern Border. Some of the more common ones are listed below. Beast
statblocks are somewhat different than Gu Master statblocks. Beasts are
missing several skills and attributes that they are incapable of using.
As they do not have a Perseverance, when beasts reach 0 hit points they
immediately die. They also do not have luck points, nor an aperture, and
as such cannot activate Gu. Stronger beasts will have wild Gu worms
living on or inside of them, however, and these Gu act independently,
usually to assist the beast they live within. When the beast is in dire
straits, however, most wild Gu will simply leave and try to escape.</p>

<h3 id="refinement-recipes">Refinement Recipes</h3>
<p>Refinement recipes have a listed market value, but that doesn’t
necessarily mean the recipe is worth that amount. The market value
assumes that this recipe is not available anywhere and there are no
extenuating circumstances. But if you have a new recipe for Dog
Enslavement Gu when the Three Kings Inheritance opens, the actual
selling price will shoot up. Once you sell it the first time, however,
the price will naturally go down somewhat. You can sell the same recipe
as many times as you want, after all. Generally, the selling price is
reduced by 75% every time it is sold.</p>
<h2 id="armor">Armor</h2>
<p>Armor is seldom seen in the Gu world, except when used by mortals.
Armor is heavy and lacks the defensive strength of even some Rank 1 Gu,
and thus has little demand. Still, some Gu Masters will use the effects
of Gu to augment their armor for better effect.</p>
<p>When wearing armor, you gain a penalty to your <strong>Dodge</strong>
rolls, but can soak up a bit more damage. Armor has a damage threshold
and health statistic. Any force or rending damage dealt to you is
reduced by the armor’s damage threshold. Any force or rending damage
dealt in excess of the damage threshold is dealt both to your hit points
and to the armor’s hit points. If the armor reaches 0 hit points, it
breaks and becomes unusable.</p>

<h2 id="skill-tests">Skill Tests</h2>
<p>Skill tests are rolled when a character would like to do an action
that: - has a chance of failure - has a chance of success</p>
<p>The GM should be able to determine if an action is possible for your
character to do, as well as if the action should be an automatic
success.</p>
<h3 id="dice">Dice</h3>
<p>Dice are notated d[sides]; a d4 is a four sided die. The td10 is a 10
sided die where each value is a tens place (10, 20, 30, etc). If instead
of the number of dice, the die is annotated with an R (Rd12), then the
number of dice is equal to the rank of the Gu. This system uses d4, d6,
d8, d10, td10, d12, and d20.</p>
<h4 id="the-d100">The d100</h4>
<p>Skill tests are rolled on a d100; to roll a d100, roll a d10 and a
td10. The td10 represents the tens place while the d10 represents the
ones place. So if you roll an 80 and a 5, your roll is 85. Rolling a 10
on the d10 is just a zero, so rolling 90 and 10 would just be 90.
Finally, rolling 00 on the td10 and a 10 on the d10 is 100. If you roll
99 or 100 on a skill test, it automatically fails and is considered a
fumble.</p>
<h3 id="penalties-and-bonuses">Penalties and Bonuses</h3>
<p>Penalties and bonuses are a number added or subtracted from the
number you roll on the die during a skill test. The GM can add either to
represent the difficulty of the check, using the table below as a
guideline. Penalties and bonuses do not have to be round multiples of
10, but they typically are.</p>

<h3 id="advantage">Advantage</h3>
<p>There is no disadvantage in this system, but many Gu will grant
advantage on certain checks. If you have advantage, roll an additional
td10 and take the lower of the two. You can stack advantages as long as
they come from different sources.</p>
<h3 id="degrees-of-successfailure">Degrees of Success/Failure</h3>
<p>For every 10 you roll above/below your skill value, you gain a degree
of failure/success, respectively. Some skill tests, such as an opposed
Deception/Insight roll, do not take degrees of success into account;
they’re either deceived or they aren’t. Many tests, however, will have
different effects based on the degrees of success or failure.</p>
<h3 id="critical">Critical</h3>
<p>When you roll at or under 1/10 of your skill’s value (rounded down)
on the die, you’ve landed a critical. Criticals are automatic successes,
though degrees of success are still calculated like normal. Some skills
have a critical success effect built into them, though the GM can always
add a special additional success to any test you critically succeed.</p>
<h3 id="fumble">Fumble</h3>
<p>Fumbles occur when 99-100 is rolled on the die for a skill test. If
your skill value is above 99, you only fumble on a roll of 100 for that
skill. Fumbles are an automatic failure, though degrees of failure are
still calculated like normal.</p>
<h3 id="opposed-tests">Opposed Tests</h3>
<p>When competing with your skills against another creature, the two of
you may be called to make an Opposed Test. You both roll a skill test,
which can be for the same or different skills, and compare results.
Critical successes beat any non-critical roll, and fumbles lose to any
non-fumble roll. Then, the player with the most degrees of success or
least degrees of failure wins. If they’re tied for degrees of
success/failure, then the lower number on the die wins. If they’re still
tied, the Opposed Test ends in a tie if possible. If the Opposed Test
can’t be tied, then the involved parties make the test again until they
do not tie.</p>
<p><em>“Today I step on grass; later I shall step on mountains and
rivers!”</em></p>
<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>
<p>To run the game, you will need a full set of dice including a d4, d6,
d8, d10, td10, d12, and d20. Additionally, each player will need a
character sheet and something to write with. This game is intended to be
played with miniatures on a grid.</p>
<h2 id="the-game-master">The Game Master</h2>
<p>Your role as GM is difficult, but ultimately rewarding. Your most
important job is making sure everyone at the table is having fun, but
that includes yourself. Come to an agreement with your players before
running the game to see what you and them want to get out of the game.
Also, remember that it is not you against the players. You’re playing
the antagonists and will certainly try to kill them. But you’re also
creating a challenge for the players to surmount, and you have the right
to be excited when they do.</p>
<p>You will be switching quickly between the roles of storyteller,
roleplayer, and rulemaker.</p>
<h3 id="storyteller">Storyteller</h3>
<p>You are the story. If your players are staying in the clan’s walls
and quietly cultivating, it’s your fault if they grow bored and don’t
know what to do. Maybe an overbearing elder puts his hand on the scale,
improving one player’s cultivation and suppressing another’s. A beast
tide could put their cultivation on hold as they struggle to defend the
clan and gain battle merits. And it’s worth knowing where each event
fits into your larger campaign. The Gu World is massive and dangerous,
so what are the villains doing in the meantime?</p>
<h3 id="rulemaker">Rulemaker</h3>
<p>There are lots of edge cases where a rule just doesn’t work. When
that happens, you make a ruling on how it should work. Listen to your
player’s input if they don’t agree, but you have the final say as
GM.</p>
<h2 id="awarding-experience">Awarding Experience</h2>
<p>There are two avenues of progression in this game: Experience and
cultivation.</p>
<p>Experience is used to purchase talents and increase attributes, while
cultivation improves a player’s raw power by increasing their pool of
primeval essence and allowing the use of higher rank Gu. Experience is
awarded for overcoming challenges such as by fighting beasts and other
Gu Masters, but can also by awarded for engaging in intrigue. The amount
of experience awarded should be reflective of the overall difficulty of
the encounter.</p>
<h3 id="encounter-difficulty">Encounter Difficulty</h3>
<p>Combat encounters can be judged by the <strong>Challenge
Rating</strong> (CR) of all creatures in the encounter. The lowest CR a
creature can have is 0, representing mortal threats like common wolves
and humans without any Gu. CR then jumps to 11. The first digit
represents the rank of the threat, and the 2nd digit represents the
estimated strength of the threat from 1-5. 1 represents initial stage, 2
middle stage, 3 upper stage, and 4 peak stage. A 5 means the threat is
especially strong for its rank and may even be able to challenge weaker
threats in the rank above it. CR caps at 54, for no mortal Gu Master
could ever pose a threat to a Gu Immortal.</p>
<p>In this game, you will create and play a Gu Master. Gu Masters are
human beings who have awakened their aperture, a kind of
extradimensional space within the stomach that can contain Gu and
primeval essence. The first thing you ought to mark down is your
starting rank. For first-time players, it is recommended to start at
rank 1 initial stage. You, your group, and the game master should also
determine if you want to follow the righteous path, living and working
with a clan, or if you’d like to tread the demonic path, living free in
the world with no masters. Your path can always be changed later on, as
demonic Gu Masters seek safety and resources, and righteous Gu Masters
grow disillusioned and yearn for freedom.</p>
<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<p>You start with 500 experience to spend on character creation. Any
experience left over afterwards is removed from the game, so that you
start your first session with 0 experience. Experience can be spent to
increase your Attributes and Skills. At character creation, attributes
cannot be raised above 50 and skills cannot be increased above 80.
Talents cannot be purchased by rank 1 Gu Masters.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 point in any attribute costs 10 experience to increase up to 50,
and 15 experience thereafter.</li>
<li>1 point in any skill (except Knowledge) costs 2 experience to
increase.</li>
<li>5 points in Strength or any single Knowledge skill costs 6
experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Experience can also be used to purchase talents, but not until</p>
<h2 id="primary-attributes">Primary Attributes</h2>
<p>Primary attributes are a generalized measure of your body and mind.
The base values of each of your skills are derived from these
attributes. All Attribute scores start at 20 before you spend any
experience to improve them. Improving an attribute also increases the
value of all derived skills and secondary attributes.</p>
<p><strong>Agility</strong> - Agility is used to dodge attacks, attack
in close quarters, and to maneuver in the air.</p>
<p><strong>Fortitude</strong> - Fortitude determines your Hit Points,
Perseverance, and Strength.</p>
<p><strong>Cognition</strong> - Your intelligence and reasoning skills.
Used to create refinement recipes, remember information, and to fight in
both close and ranged combat.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom</strong> - Wisdom increases your speed of cultivation,
how often you succeed when refining Gu, and awareness of your
surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>Attitude</strong> - Attitude represents your understanding of
human nature, relationships, and emotions. A higher attitude makes it
easier to deceive and persuade others, and to know when others are
deceiving you. It also is a minor factor in your Perseverance.</p>
<h2 id="secondary-attributes">Secondary Attributes</h2>
<p>Secondary attributes either have a flat base value or are derived
from your primary attributes.</p>
<h3 id="health">Health</h3>
<p>You have a pool of Hit Points equal to your Fortitude. You can read
about how damage, dying, and injury works in the combat chapter.</p>
<h3 id="movement-1">Movement</h3>
<p>Your Movement is the number of meters you can move in a turn. Your
Movement is 6 meters.</p>
<h3 id="strength">Strength</h3>
<p>Your body’s physical power. Strength is often overlooked by Gu
Masters, as even rank 1 Gu can overpower the strongest of mortals. But
battles are unpredictable, and when primeval essence runs dry Gu Masters
may resort to a fistfight. Though this statistic is more relevant at
rank 1, some Gu Masters choose to use Gu to enhance their strength and
rely on their own muscles to pound their enemies into meat paste. Your
Strength score begins equal to your Fortitude, rounded down, and affects
the amount of damage you deal with attacks where your physical strength
is a factor.</p>
<h3 id="perseverance">Perseverance</h3>
<p>Your Perseverance is your ability to endure great pain and stress,
and is equal to the sum of your Fortitude and 1/2 of your Attitude,
rounded down. Perseverance is rolled when you hit 0 Hit Points.</p>
<h3 id="soul">Soul</h3>
<p>Your Soul score is a literal representation of the strength of your
soul. Your starting Soul value is 10. Refining Gu, cultivating, and
controlling beast groups all drain the strength of your soul, while
sleeping restores it. Many soul-path Gu also use the strength of your
soul to determine their strength when activated. If your current soul
ever hits 0 points, you die. When you sleep, your soul recovers 10% of
its maximum (rounded down) for every hour spent sleeping. Sleeping for
at least 10 hours fully rejuvenates your soul, regardless of
rounding.</p>
<p>Your soul begins at 10, the single-man soul. Many soul-path Gu can
strengthen your soul and increase this value. Whenever your soul takes
1/2 or more of its maximum value in soul damage on a single turn, roll
1d6 and reduce the maximum value of your soul by that amount.</p>
<p>When your soul reaches strength 100, you have the ten-man soul. It
has the proper strength to sustain damage; you no longer lose maximum
soul when you take more than 1/2 of your souls maximum in soul
damage.</p>
<p>When your soul reaches strength 1,000, you have the hundred-man soul.
If you have not refined your soul using Gu, this is the maximum strength
achievable. If your soul increases in strength above 1009 without being
refined, your soul explodes and you die, with resurrection being
impossible. The hundred-man soul is the minimum strength needed for many
soul-mutation Gu, such as Wolf Soul Gu.</p>
<p>When your soul reaches strength 10,000, you have the thousand-man
soul. This is the limit for mortal Gu Masters and cannot be raised
higher.</p>
<h3 id="luck">Luck</h3>
<p>Players begin with 1 maximum luck point. Luck can be spent to force
you or another creature to reroll a skill test directly after the roll,
or to add a -50 bonus to a skill test you’re making, before the roll. If
you’ve expended a luck point on a skill test, you cannot spend another
on the same skill test. You regain luck points up to your maximum at the
start of each session.</p>
<h3 id="activations-1">Activations</h3>
<p>On your turn, you can activate a number of Gu equal to your
Activations. You have a number of Activations equal to 5% of your Wisdom
plus 5% of your Cognition, rounding both down to a minimum of 1. To make
this calculation easier, consider that for every 20 score you have in
either attribute, this number will increase by 1, with a minimum of 2.
<em>Shang Liu has a Cognition of 45 and a Wisdom of 32. Every 20 score
in either attribute gives one Activation, bringing his total Activations
to 3.</em></p>
<h2 id="aptitude">Aptitude</h2>
<p>Your Gu Master’s aptitude is incredibly important to their
cultivation and battle strength. A higher aptitude means greater
primeval essence, meaning your Gu Master can fight for longer and
cultivate quicker. Aptitude is mostly immutable, but some Gu exist to
raise or even lower a Gu Master’s aptitude.</p>
<p>Choosing your Gu Master’s aptitude is a decision that will
significantly shape their journey. Higher aptitudes offer undeniable
advantages in cultivation speed, primeval essence, and clan support, but
they come with the heavy burdens of increased clan expectations,
heightened scrutiny, and potential danger. Lower aptitudes, while slower
in cultivation, afford your Gu Master greater freedom, fewer
obligations, and opportunities to forge their own path.</p>
<p>It is also worth considering the other players in your group. If one
player is an A-grade aptitude and another is D-grade, your ranks will
most likely diverge dramatically in the early to mid stages. This
difference is not insurmountable, but it may not be enjoyable for the
weaker Gu Master. It’s recommended for the group to decide on 2 adjacent
grades and have each player pick one of the two.</p>
<p>Aptitude is just an arbitrary grading of the amount of primeval
essence a Gu Master’s aperture can store. After choosing your aptitude,
roll a d20, subtract 1 from the result, and add it to the minimum
essence percentage of your grade to determine your personal maximum
primeval essence.</p>
<p><em>For example, Shang Liu chooses A-grade aptitude and rolls a 4 on
his d20. Subtract 1 to get 3 and add that to the minimum of 80%. Shang
Liu therefore has 83% as his maximum.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grade - A:</strong> 80%-99% <strong>Grade - B:</strong>
60%-79% <strong>Grade - C:</strong> 40%-59% <strong>Grade - D:</strong>
20%-39%</p>
<h2 id="attainment">Attainment</h2>
<p>Attainment is your understanding of the different Gu paths. That
includes your knowledge of refining, using, and identifying Gu of the
same path. You can find the different attainments in the Talents
chapter, and your character begins the game with <em>Fundamental</em>
attainment in a single path.</p>
<h2 id="starting-items">Starting Items</h2>
<p>All characters start with a Gu Master robe, a Vital Gu of rank 1, and
25 primeval stones. At the GM’s discretion (for price and availability)
you may trade your starting primeval stones for additional rank 1
Gu.</p>
<h2 id="lifespan">Lifespan</h2>
<p>If your character reaches age 100 without using <em>Lifespan Gu</em>,
they die.</p>
<p>Your character’s Skills represent their learned abilities and
proficiencies, whether that be in combat, dialogue, or cultivation. The
base value of the skill is dependent on what attribute(s) it is derived
from, shown in the parenthesis. Remember to increase your skill values
whenever you purchase points in the corresponding attribute.</p>
<p><strong>Close Combat (1/2 Agi + 1/2 Cog)</strong> - Close Combat does
not only include fighting hand-to-hand, it relates to any fighting that
occurs within 2 meters of you. Many attack Gu can be used at range or in
close combat, and this skill represents your ability to make attacks at
a close range. Melee attacks are always made with your close combat
skill.</p>
<p><strong>Ranged Combat (Cog)</strong> - If an enemy is further than 2
meters from you, your non-melee attacks will be made with the Ranged
Combat skill.</p>
<p><strong>Athletics (1/2 Str + 1/2 Agi)</strong> - Athletics is used
for strength related actions such as pushing a boulder, climbing a steep
cliff, or swimming. #### Pushing, Pulling, and Lifting You can push or
pull any weight under 100kg without making a test, halving your movement
(rounded down) if the weight is over 50kg. Above 100kg you must make an
<strong>Athletics</strong> test with a -40 bonus, increased by +10 for
every 50kg over 100.</p>
<p><strong>Dodge (Agi)</strong> - Dodge is used as a reaction to avoid
attacks made against you, either melee or ranged.</p>
<p>When you succeed a Dodge test, you MUST move at least 1 meter and at
most 1/2 your movement (rounded down) in any direction.</p>
<p><strong>Flying (Agi)</strong> - A Gu Master may live his entire life
without taking to the skies, but to those that do, this skill is a
necessity. Without a decent flying skill, a Gu Master can be easier to
hit in the air than they would be on the ground.</p>
<p>The source of your flight tells you how many meters you can move per
turn. When flying, unless otherwise stated by the flight source, you</p>
<h3 id="refinement-wis"><strong>Refinement (Wis)</strong></h3>
<p>Even with a complete recipe, refining Gu is an arduous process,
requiring precision and constant vigilance. When refinement fails it
triggers a backlash which can hurt or even kill you and your Gu. Your
refinement skill determines how complex of recipes you can follow, and
how often your refinement fails.</p>
<h3 id="deduction-cog"><strong>Deduction (Cog)</strong></h3>
<p>Deduction is used to create and refine Gu recipes as well as to
develop killer moves; the combination of multiple Gu used simultaneously
to deliver a very potent effect. It can also be used to investigate your
surroundings for clues.</p>
<p>Some Gu have the [<strong>Deductive</strong>] keyword. When
activated, these Gu unlock a special <strong>Deduction</strong> action.
To take it, you must spend an hour deducing a specific subject and make
a <strong>Deduction</strong> test. Penalties and Bonuses are determined
by the amount of supporting information available to you. The subject
can be something that occured in the past, such as who might have
committed a murder, or something happening in the present or future,
like why a rival clan purchased a huge amount of an unusual refinement
material. Deductions cannot create information out of thin air, and a
success does not necessarily mean your deduction is correct if you lack
a key piece of evidence. For every degree of success on the check,
however, you gain one additional conclusion about the subject.</p>

<h3 id="knowledge-cog"><strong>Knowledge (Cog)</strong></h3>
<p>Knowledge is separated into a few categories: - Gu - There are an
uncountable number of different Gu in the world, and this skill helps to
identify them. In a fight, it can mean life or death. - Southern Border
- Your understanding of the geography, flora, and fauna of Southern
Border. It can be assumed that all characters will have knowledge of the
areas surrounding their clan, but when journeying beyond familiarity
this skill can be used to identify beasts, plants, and natural
formations. - Clans - Small, medium, large, and super-sized clans dot
the mountains and valleys of Southern Border. This skill represents your
knowledge of their names, power structures, specialties, and
commerce.</p>
<h2 id="cultivating">Cultivating</h2>
<p>The process of increases your rank in small and large realms is
called cultivating. To cultivate, you must meditate and will the
primeval essence in your aperture to attack and weaken the aperture
walls. To do so, first figure out how many portions of primeval essence
will be required to break through the realm. For small realms, the
amount is given by the table below. For large realms, the amount is
(1000 * target rank) portions.</p>
<table>

</table>
<p>When you’re attempting to break through a small realm, the walls
retain any damage done by your primeval essence, thus you can slowly
break through over time. If you spend an hour cultivating, you can
expend as much primeval essence as you want to, permanently reducing the
health of your aperture walls by the number of portions expended.</p>
<p>Large realms, on the other hand, are not so easy. When you’re trying
to break through from peak stage of a rank to the next rank, first take
your primeval essence recovery rate, add the recovery from any primeval
stones you’re consuming, and subtract (16 * target rank) to represent
the natural recovery rate of your aperture walls.</p>
<p>If the number you calculated is positive, you can move on to the next
step. If it is negative, you’ll have to increase your recovery rate via
consuming primeval stones or use a Gu that assists in cultivation to
break through to the next stage.</p>
<p>Now, subtract however much essence you have in your aperture from the
total number of portions required to break through. Divide that number
by the recovery number you calculated in the previous step. This is how
many hours straight you will need to cultivate to break through to the
next realm. You can round this number up to the nearest hour.</p>
<p>For each hour spent cultivating, whether breaking through a small or
large realm, make a <strong>Cultivation</strong> test with a bonus
according to the table below. If you fail, your soul takes damage equal
to the degrees of failure (minimum of 1).</p>

<h3 id="consuming-primeval-stones">Consuming Primeval Stones</h3>
<p>You can expend primeval stones while cultivating to make up for not
having a high enough recovery rate, and you may do so to assist in
breaking through both small and large realms. You may expend up to 10
primeval stones per hour spent cultivating, increasing your recovery
rate for that hour by 5 for each stone consumed when breaking through
large realms, or dealing 5 damage to the aperture walls for each stone
consumed when breaking through small realms.</p>
<h2 id="spending-experience">Spending Experience</h2>
<p>In addition to progressing through cultivation, you also get more
skilled as a Gu Master as time passes. The GM will award experience at
the end of each session, recommended to be between 8-12 experience.
Experience earned in this way can be stockpiled, and a few Gu are even
be able to consume it as a resource. At the GM’s discretion, the players
will be allowed to spend their accrued experience at a particular time.
Typical situations to allow spending of experience are either when the
party is safe and able to rest, or whenever they increase their
cultivation.</p>
<h3 id="combat-absorption">Combat Absorption</h3>
<p><em>Cost:</em> 60 experience You can multitask on absorbing primeval
stones in the heat of combat. Absorbing the essence of primeval stones
now takes up your bonus action instead of a combat action.</p>
<h3 id="flying-master">Flying Master</h3>
<p><em>Cost:</em> 40 experience Taking flight no longer expends one of

only be used to improve your <strong>Flying</strong> skill.</p>
<h3 id="multitasker">Multitasker</h3>
<p><em>Cost:</em> 40 experience <em>Can be purchased up to 3 times</em>
You can sustain an additional Gu every turn without incurring damage to

<h3 id="multi-weapon-fighting-1">Multi-Weapon Fighting</h3>
<p><em>Cost:</em> 20 experience You can make a number of melee attacks

<p><em>Cost:</em> 15 experience <em>Can be purchased up to 3 times</em>
When you purchase this talent, pick a class of mundane weapons (swords,
spears, bows) or a single Gu.</p>
<p>You gain a -10 bonus on close combat and ranged attack rolls made
with the chosen weapon for each time you’ve purchased this talent and
selected that weapon. If a Gu is very close in form to the chosen
weapon, you still get this bonus. This usually includes higher ranked
versions of the same Gu.</p>
<h2 id="path-attainments">Path Attainments</h2>
<p>It’s difficult to use Gu of a path you aren’t familiar with. Every
character starts with <em>Fundamental</em> attainment in a single path.
Oftentimes, a Gu Master that achieves master level attainment in any
path gains great fame for their accomplishment, and may be contacted by
other forces to refine Gu or complete difficult tasks related to the
path.</p>
<p>You cannot purchase a path attainment unless you have purchased all
previous attainments in the same path. So you cannot purchase master
attainment in a path unless you also have purchased fundamantal and
intermediate attainment.</p>
<h3 id="path-attainment">[] Path Attainment</h3>
<p><strong>Fundamental</strong> <em>Cost:</em> 30 experience You gain an
additional bonus action that can only be used to activate a single []
path Gu on your turn.</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate</strong> <em>Cost:</em> 50 experience Your
understanding of [] path has reached a qualitative change, and you gain
the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You gain a -20 bonus to all <strong>Refinement</strong> and
<strong>Knowledge (Gu)</strong> tests to refine or identify [] path
Gu.</li>
<li><strong>Deduction</strong> tests made to develop killer moves gain a
-10 bonus for each [] path Gu in its core.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Master</strong> <em>Cost:</em> 100 experience Your
understanding of [] path reaches the apex of mortal comprehension. You
gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You automatically succeed all <strong>Refinement</strong> and
<strong>Deduction</strong> tests to refine or improve the recipe of []
path Gu, so long as the Gu is of a lower rank than you. You still have
to roll the failure die after a successful refinement.</li>
<li>You gain a -30 bonus to all <strong>Refinement</strong> and
<strong>Knowledge (Gu)</strong> tests to refine or identify [] path
Gu.</li>
<li>You gain a -30 bonus to <strong>Deduction</strong> tests made to
improve or create refinement recipes for [] path Gu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Humans are the spirit of all living beings and Gu are the essence of
heaven and earth. Mortal Gu represent fragments of the great Dao, or
laws of Heaven, and are ranked from 1 to 5, just like mortal Gu Masters.
Gu come in many different forms, with bugs being a common motif, but
there are just as many that take the forms of beasts and objects. Gu can
be either wild or refined; wild Gu usually refers to those birthed from
natural primeval essence. These can come into being in any manner of
places as long as the conditions are right. Sometimes they are carried
by beasts, or roaming the earth alone, or staying sedentary in the place
they were born. Refined Gu are those under the direct control of a Gu
Master. They obey the user’s commands without fail, even destroying
themselves with a single thought. The Gu Master can acquire refined Gu
by refining wild Gu, creating them themselves using their Refinement
skill, or acquiring them from others. Refined Gu may become wild Gu if
their master is killed, but this process takes some time.</p>
<p>Gu are separated into different categories based on the effect
created when they are activated. These categories have minimal
mechanical importance but give a good idea of the Gu’s purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Attack</strong> - Shooting a blade, controlling someone’s
mind, or softening a person’s bones are all attacks. If the primary use
of the Gu is to kill or apply negative effects to a person against their
will, it is an attack.</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation</strong> - Creates an object, such as a beast,
house, or even wings under the user’s control. Can be permanent or
temporary.</p>
<p><strong>Guard</strong> - Forms a defensive barrier with the primary
focus being blocking attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Celerity</strong> - Enhances speed or maneuverability.</p>
<p><strong>Divination</strong> - Gathers information, whether from a
short distance or across the continent. Investigative Gu that increase a
user’s perception are included, as well as those that surveil areas or
probe into people’s minds.</p>
<p><strong>Concealment</strong> - Hides the user’s presence in any
number of ways.</p>
<p><strong>Tonic</strong> - Gu with a restorative effect. There exist
tonic Gu for humans, beasts, and even other Gu.</p>
<p><strong>Container</strong> - If objects can be placed inside, the Gu
is typically a container. They can store objects, gu, and sometimes even
people. Convenient for storing items and resources safely within your
aperture.</p>
<p><strong>Catalyst</strong> - A catch-all category for Gu that can be
used to supplement other Gu and actions. Gu that increase the likelihood
of refinement success, improve cultivation speed, or amplify the effects
of other Gu are all catalysts.</p>
<p><strong>Carver</strong> - Carves dao semi-permanently into the
recipient. The most common carvers belong to strength and information
path, used to increase a user’s strength and create binding agreements,
respectively.</p>
<p>Below is a sample statblock for the rank 1 <em>Moonlight Gu</em>.
This is the signature Gu of the Gu Yue clan, and cannot be found
anywhere else in Southern Border.</p>
<p><strong>Moonlight Gu</strong> <em>Rank 1 Attack</em> (<em>This
signifies that the Gu is of Rank 1, and is an Attack-type Gu</em>)</p>
<p>Cost: 5 portions (<em>This Gu costs 5 portions to activate for a rank
1 Gu Master. Rank 2 and above Gu Masters instead only spend 1
portion</em>)</p>
<p>Range: 10 meters</p>
<p>Health: 10 (<em>This Gu has 10 health. If it hits 0, it
dies</em>)</p>
<p>Food: Moon orchid petals (3 primeval stones) (<em>This gu eats moon
orchid petals. Since it is a rank 1 Gu, it eats every 3 days. When you
have access to a market, you can substitute the materials with 3
primeval stones.</em>)</p>
<p>Effect: You hurl a flat, crescent-shaped beam of light. Make an
attack roll with a -10 bonus. On a hit, deal 8 rending damage.</p>
<h3 id="vital-gu">Vital Gu</h3>
<p>The first Gu you refine gains the [<strong>Vital</strong>] keyword
and becomes your Vital Gu. Yours and your Vital Gu’s lifeforces are
connected, and if your Vital Gu should die, you would as well. The Vital
Gu has a major advantage, however; It cannot die due to backlash during
refinement, instead dropping to 1 hp and being unusable in refinement
until its hit points are restored to their maximum. This makes your
Vital Gu a very important choice for progression, as you can attempt to
refine it to a higher rank many times without worrying about its
death.</p>
<p>To change your Vital Gu, you must spend a day in closed cultivation
with the new Gu. When you change your Vital Gu, your current hit points
are reduced to 1 as you suffer backlash. Your Vital Gu can be of any
rank.</p>
<h3 id="rank">Rank</h3>
<p>Mortal Gu have a rank of 1-5. Some Gu exist only at a single rank,
others are found at several ranks, and others can only be raised in rank
through refinement. For example, the rank 1 Dog Enslavement Gu can
enslave a single dog. Rank 2 dog enslavement Gu can enslave a Hundred
Beast King dog, rank 3 can enslave a Thousand Beast King dog, and so on,
with each being found on increasingly strong dogs. The higher the rank
of the Gu, the rarer it is, and their strength increases
exponentially.</p>
<p>Gu above rank 5 are called Immortal Gu. Most can only be activated
with Immortal Essence, though a few have other costs that can be paid by
mortals. Forgetting mortal Gu Masters, even Rank 6 Gu Masters may live
their entire life without owning an Immortal Gu. Each one is unique, and
for however long it exists in the world, nobody else can refine a copy.
When one appears, many Gu Immortals will fight to the death to get their
hands on it, and when they fight, many tens of thousands of mortals can
and do die in the crossfire.</p>
<h3 id="series">Series</h3>
<p>Some Gu belong to a series that spans multiple ranks. Some have
additional effects based on their rank and will be listed separately.
Others just scale up in numbers and will be under the same listing. If
several values are inside curly braces, they represent the value at
different ranks. If a Gu exists at ranks 3-5 and creates {1, 10, 100}
fireballs, then it creates 1 fireball at rank 3, 10 at rank 4, and 100
at rank 5.</p>
<h3 id="price">Price</h3>
<p>Price is largely dependent on the rank of the Gu in question, but the
market also needs to be considered. Relic Gu, for example, are quite
rare and of an enormous help to a Gu Master’s cultivation, which makes
them significantly more expensive than other Gu of the same rank. Smelly
Fart Gu, on the other hand, is practically worthless except as a
refinement material, and thus would be cheaper than other Gu of the same
rank. Use the prices below as a starting point.</p>
<table>
<thead>

</table>
<p>Rank 4 and rank 5 Gu are significantly rarer than Gu of rank 1 to 3.
It may be difficult to find a seller, and you may even encounter schemes
and resistances from your opposition when trying to buy them.</p>
<h3 id="primeval-essence-costs">Primeval Essence Costs</h3>
<p>Gu statblocks will have a number of portions it costs to activate.
This assumes you are of the same rank as the Gu. If your rank is lower
than the Gu, your primeval essence is too weak, and the Gu costs 4 times
as many portions to activate for every rank above you the Gu is. If you
are Rank 2 and try to activate a Rank 4 Gu that costs 10 portions,
instead it will cost you 160 portions. If the Gu is below your rank, it
only costs a single portion of your primeval essence to activate.</p>
<h3 id="wild-gu-1">Wild Gu</h3>
<p>Wild Gu are found in the wilderness, typically in an environment rich
with Dao of the Gu’s path. Wild Gu have a speed of 8 meters and will
attempt to evade capture. Wild Gu can see through <em>concealments</em>
of a lower rank than itself.</p>
<h2 id="refining-gu">Refining Gu</h2>
<p>Refining Gu can refer to two processes; the first is turning a wild
Gu or a Gu refined by someone else into your own. The second is the act
of following a recipe to create a new Gu. You cannot activate a Gu that
is wild or belongs to someone else, unless the owner is willing.</p>
<h3 id="refining-existing-gu">Refining Existing Gu</h3>
<p>When refining a wild Gu, the Gu must be subdued first. For smaller Gu
this usually just involves catching it, but larger or more aggressive Gu
may require you to weaken it in battle or through other means. If the Gu
is owned by someone else, they can weaken their will to allow you to
refine the Gu for free. Otherwise, your will is pit against theirs. Make
an opposed Wisdom test against the owner of the Gu, with the higher
ranked Gu Master gaining a -30 bonus for each rank they are above their
opponent. If you win the test, the owner’s will is driven out and you
gain ownership of the Gu. If you lose, they retain control of the Gu,
you take 1d4 damage to your soul, and you gain a stacking -10 bonus on
subsequent rolls made to refine the Gu.</p>
<p>Once a wild Gu is subdued, you must be touching it to refine it into
your own. To do so, you must spend 50 portions of primeval essence. If
the Gu is of a higher rank than you, it costs 4 times more portions to
refine for each rank above you.</p>
<p>If the Gu is below your rank, it costs a single portion of primeval
essence to refine.</p>
<p>If you do not have enough primeval essence to do so in one sitting,
you may have to refine the Gu for a longer period, using your natural
recovery and/or primeval stones to supply the rest of the required
portions. Taking a break from the refinement causes it to fail, and the
primeval essence used in the process is lost.</p>
<h3 id="following-a-recipe">Following a Recipe</h3>
<p>Refinement recipes will have many required materials. Common
materials are included in the recipe’s primeval stone cost, assuming you
have access to a market to purchase the materials. Rarer materials will
be specified, and you may have to seek out a seller or go find these
materials yourself. Some recipes will also have an associated ritual
which will have to be completed for the refinement to succeed.</p>
<p>To begin refinement, you must have all the necessary materials on
hand. Make a <strong>Refinement</strong> test with a penalty or bonus
according to the recipe’s difficulty. If you’ve already successfully
refined the Gu before, you gain a -20 bonus on the test. On a success,
roll the failure die. If the number rolled is anything except a 1, you
have succeeded in creating the Gu. If you do roll a 1, the refinement
fails, representing the flat chance of failure all refinement recipes
have. If you succeeded, however, cut the duration in half for every
degree of success on the refinement test (barring any rituals involved
that take a set amount of time).</p>
<p>On a failure, you and all Gu being used in the refinement process
take a backlash. If you failed the roll by less than 10, or if the
failure was caused by a 1 on the failure die, the backlash is negated.
Otherwise, you take damage to your soul equal to the degrees of failure
multiplied by the rank of the Gu you’re attempting to refine. Every Gu
being used in the refinement takes the same amount of damage to their
health. If your Vital Gu would be killed in this manner, instead it
drops to 1 hit point.</p>
<p>For every 8 hours you spend refining Gu without a rest, take 1d6
damage to your soul.</p>
<h4 id="sample-recipe-four-flavors-liquor-worm">Sample Recipe: Four

<p><strong>Failure Die:</strong> d10</p>
<p><strong>Market Value:</strong> 20,000 primeval stones</p>
<h3 id="improving-a-recipe">Improving a Recipe</h3>
<p>You can leverage your <strong>Deduction</strong> skill to reduce the
cost, duration, difficulty, or failure rate of any Gu recipe. To do so,
you must have a <strong>Refinement</strong> skill of (20 * recipe rank)
as well as <em>intermediate</em> attainment in the path of the Gu in
question to attempt the refinement. If you do, start by paying 4 times
the total cost of the recipe, to represent the materials needed to
practice and attempt to improve the recipe. You must also spend an
amount of time equal to 4 times the duration of the recipe in
refinement. This time does not need to be sequential, and you can breaks
as long as you need and however often you need. Then, make a
<strong>Deduction</strong> test with a +10 penalty per rank of the Gu
recipe. On a fumble, you do not succeed in improving the recipe and take
damage to your soul equal to the degrees of failure multiplied by the
rank of the recipe. On a failure, you do not succeed in improving the
recipe, but don’t face a backlash. On a success, you make a breakthrough
and gain a new recipe for the Gu, with one of the following
improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The failure die is increased by one step; d2 -&gt; d4 -&gt; d6 -&gt;
d8 -&gt; d10 -&gt; d12 -&gt; d20 -&gt; d100</li>
<li>The difficulty is reduced by 10</li>
<li>The primeval stone cost is reduced by 25% OR remove one additional
cost (you cannot remove a Gu from the cost if the recipe is to advance
that Gu up a rank)</li>
<li>The duration is reduced by 50%</li>
</ul>
<p>The recipe you’ve created is different from the previous one, and
both can still be used and sold. The market value of the new recipe is
worth double that of the original. You can improve a recipe a number of
times equal to 10% of your refinement skill, rounded down.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-recipe">Creating a Recipe</h3>
<p>Creating a recipe is a collaborative effort between the player and
GM.</p>
<h2 id="feeding-gu">Feeding Gu</h2>
<p>Gu are living beings and need to be fed. What they eat is determined
by the Gu, while how often they eat is determined by the rank. Some Gu
will have a number of primeval stones in parenthesis next to their food.
If you have access to a market, you can spend that number of primeval
stones for a feeding. Gu also cannot be fed during combat.</p>
<table>

<p>If the food does not have a primeval stone cost next to it, that does
not mean it is impossible to purchase, just that it is a rarer material.
You can find your own out in the Southern Border, or seek out a seller
of rare items.</p>
<p>To track food, mark the Gu’s feeding interval in days inside the
“Days Until Feeding” column on your Gu sheet. Every time a day passes in
game, subtract 1 from the number. When the Gu eats, set it back to the
original feeding interval. If it hits -1, the Gu starves to death. You
can feed a Gu outside of combat whenever you wish as long as you have
the materials.</p>
<h2 id="detonating-gu">Detonating Gu</h2>
<p>As a reaction or at any time during their turn, a Gu Master can
self-detonate any Gu owned and refined by them with a single thought.
The Gu Master must be conscious to do so, and can detonate as many or as
few Gu as they want, from any distance. If the Gu is being suppressed,
for example by the land spirit of a blessed land, the Gu Master cannot
self-detonate it. Otherwise, the chosen Gu instantly die, with no other
effects. If the Gu has a self-detonation ability, it does not trigger,
since the Gu was not activated.</p>
<h2 id="healing-gu">Healing Gu</h2>
<p>Gu have a pool of hit points, and thus need to be healed when
damaged. Most Gu heal back to full health when they are fed. Some Gu can
only be healed by other Gu or an obscure process.</p>
<h2 id="gu-against-gu">Gu against Gu</h2>
<p>Sometimes the effects of Gu will be pit against one another. In most
circumstances, the higher rank Gu’s effect takes precedence. If both are
the same rank, the defending Gu should block the effect. For example, if
a Gu Master is attacked by Rank 2 Vein Burst Gu, but has strengthened
his blood vessels with Rank 2 Iron Artery Gu, then he would be
unaffected, despite neither Gu explicitly mentioning the interaction.
Concealments are considered the defender when pit against
Divinations.</p>
<p>The Gu system has a lot of moving parts, and it would be unfun and
tedious if every effect listed every possible counter and use case. When
there’s uncertainty about whether a Gu would affect a target, use common
sense, and if that fails the GM will have to make a ruling.</p>
<p>If a Gu would negate the damage of a Gu of higher rank (like a guard
Gu that negates damage of a certain type), instead it reduces it to 1/2
(rounded down).</p>
<h1 id="gu-keywords">Gu Keywords</h1>
<h3 id="deductive">Deductive</h3>
<p>When activated, [<strong>Deductive</strong>] Gu unlock a special
<em>Deduction</em> action. To take it, you must spend an hour deducing a
specific subject and make a <strong>Deduction</strong> test. Penalties
and Bonuses are determined by the amount of supporting information
available to you. The subject can be something that occured in the past,
such as who might have committed a murder, or something happening in the
present or future, like why a rival clan may have purchased a huge
amount of an unusual refinement material. Deductions cannot create
information out of thin air, and a success does not necessarily mean
your deduction is correct if you lack a key piece of evidence. For every
degree of success on the check, however, you gain one additional
conclusion about the subject.</p>
<h3 id="dao">Dao</h3>
<p>Gu with the [<strong>Dao</strong>] keyword contain much higher traces
of dao than most mortal Gu. Dao of different paths naturally conflict,
and a Gu Master cannot gain the effect from a [<strong>Dao</strong>] Gu
if they are already under the effect of a [<strong>Dao</strong>] Gu of a
different path.</p>
<h3 id="defensive">Defensive</h3>
<p>[<strong>Defensive</strong>] Gu can be activated as a reaction to
being hit by or affected by another Gu or attack.</p>
<h3 id="fast">Fast</h3>
<p>[<strong>Fast</strong>] Gu have a movement of 12 meters instead of
8.</p>
<h3 id="expendable-x">Expendable X</h3>
<p>[<strong>Expendable</strong>] Gu are destroyed after X uses. If there
is no number, the Gu can only be used a single time before it is
destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="low-vitality">Low Vitality</h3>
<p>[<strong>Low Vitality</strong>] Gu do not regenerate hit points when
they are fed. Most will clarify the necessary Gu or process used to
recover their health instead.</p>
<h3 id="piercing">Piercing</h3>
<p>[<strong>Piercing</strong>] Gu can pierce through any material that
lacks dao. The only barriers with dao would be either refinement
materials or barriers created by Gu. Mundane armor worn by a creature
struck by a [<strong>Piercing</strong>] attack does not reduce the
damage of the attack, and the armor takes damage equal to the damage of
the attack to its hit points.</p>
<h3 id="shield">Shield</h3>
<p>When you take damage, it is first dealt to any active
[<strong>Shield</strong>] Gu, so long as the Gu can block that damage
type. If you use a [<strong>Shield</strong>] Gu to reduce damage, the Gu
takes that damage to its hitpoints. If a [<strong>Shield</strong>] Gu
would die from sustaining an attack while active, you may use a reaction
to deactivate the Gu at 1 hit point, taking the remaining damage to your
hit points or another [<strong>Shield</strong>] Gu.</p>
<p>If you have multiple [<strong>Shield</strong>] Gu active, you choose
in what order they absorb damage and can split incoming damage between
any number of active [<strong>Shield</strong>] Gu. This way, if you have
a shield that negates fire damage and another that negates rending
damage, you could split all rending and fire damage in a way that
negates all of the incoming damage.</p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>If size is not listed, the Gu is the most common size,
[<strong>Tiny</strong>]; that of an insect. If the Gu is
[<strong>Small</strong>] it is the size of a child, and
[<strong>Medium</strong>] is the size of a man. [<strong>Large</strong>]
Gu take up 4 squares when outside of your aperture, and
[<strong>Huge</strong>] Gu take up any area greater than 9 squares.</p>

<h3 id="steed">Steed</h3>
<p>A [<strong>Steed</strong>] Gu can be ridden while outside your
aperture. While mounted, your movement is replaced with the
[<strong>Steed</strong>] Gu’s movement statistics.</p>
<h3 id="supplementary">Supplementary</h3>
<p>Supplementary Gu can change the properties of your subsequent
activations. When used outside of killer moves,
[<strong>Supplementary</strong>] Gu have no effect on Gu of a higher
rank than itself. When used as supplementary Gu in a killer move, you
will require a number of the same [<strong>Supplementary</strong>] Gu to
properly apply the effect equal to 2^(killer move rank -
[<strong>Supplementary</strong>] Gu rank).</p>
<h3 id="sustained">Sustained</h3>
<p>You must pay the cost of [<strong>Sustained</strong>] Gu at the start
of each of your turns as long as you keep the effect active. Paying the
cost does not use one of your activations. While a Gu is being
sustained, it cannot be activated (because it is already active). If you
are sustaining more than 1 Gu at the same time, take 1 damage to your
soul for every Gu being sustained above your
<strong>Activations</strong> attribute at the start of each of your
turns.</p>
<p>You may stop sustaining a Gu at any time, whether or not it is your
turn. If you fall unconscious or are <em>stunned</em>, you automatically
stop sustaining all Gu.</p>
<h3 id="unreactable">Unreactable</h3>
<p>Attacks made with [<strong>Unreactable</strong>] Gu are too fast for
the defending Gu master to react in time. When a Gu Master uses a
reaction in response to the activation or effect of an
[<strong>Unreactable</strong>] Gu, their reaction is delayed until after
the Gu’s successful activation and application of its effect.</p>
<h3 id="vital">Vital</h3>
<p>A Gu Master can only have 1 [<strong>Vital</strong>] Gu at a time. If
a Gu with the [<strong>Vital</strong>] keyword dies, the owner of the Gu
dies as well. When taking damage from refinement backlash, a
[<strong>Vital</strong>] Gu cannot be brought below 1 hit point.</p>
<h2 id="creating-unique-gu">Creating Unique Gu</h2>
<p>While I’ve made an expansive list of many of the Gu paths, in reality
there is a basically unlimited number of Gu. Once you’re more familiar
with the system and balance, you’re encouraged to make your own Gu. Here
are some guidelines;</p>
<ul>
<li>Gu type (attack, guard, celerity, etc.) has no mechanical effect and
only exists for easier categorization.</li>
<li>Rank 5 Gu are at the peak of the mortal realm, and have the power to
clear sections of a battlefield single handedly. Rank 1 Gu are sometimes
strong enough to kill a person. Keep in mind that a Gu of higher rank
should usually have an advantage over lower ranked Gu.</li>
<li>The rules already account for the differing primeval essence quality
between ranks. Costs are proportional to the power of the Gu within its
rank. A rank 1 Gu with a high cost can be similar in strength to a rank
2 Gu with low cost.</li>
<li>Health is usually only relevant to Gu with the
[<strong>Shield</strong>] or [<strong>Steed</strong>] keywords or for
refinement. Gu with higher health are more likely to survive backlash
from refinement and are thus more viable for improvement.</li>
<li>Range can be Self (an area of effect centered on yourself or an
effect that only applies to the user), Touch, or a distance in
meters.</li>
<li>Duration can be permanent or have a specified duration. Duration can
be in the form of time (minutes/hours/days/years) or with respect to the
turn. If the Gu applies an effect for 1 turn, its typically better to
say “until the end of your/their next turn.” This is because the number
of turns remaining on an effect ticks down at the end of the creature’s
turn; if you buff yourself on your turn, and the duration of the effect
is 1 turn, it would disappear at the end of your turn and not be active
when you take any of your reactions outside your turn.</li>
<li>Overall, the strength of the Gu should be relative to all these
factors. If it is more expensive in primeval essence, has a short range,
eats expensive food, and/or has major drawbacks to its use, the power of
the Gu should be increased relatively. This can mean more damage, more
health (for [<strong>Shield</strong>] Gu), making the Gu harder to
counter, and so on. A Gu that costs 2 portions, eats dirt, and affects
1km better have a much weaker effect than other Gu in its rank. Adding
the [<strong>Expendable</strong>] or [<strong>Low Vitality</strong>]
keywords can also be used to balance a Gu that’s on the stronger
side.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, be creative! There is a Gu for any purpose you can
think of. There are Gu suited to cure any affliction, make any attack,
cause any event that you can think of. Some Gu might seem practically
useless, but they can always be used to improve some killer move or
refine a new Gu.</p>
<p>Enslavement path Gu Masters are a huge asset to a clan. In battle, a
single enslavement path Gu Master can be worth many other Gu Masters of
the same rank, as they use Enslavement Gu to dominate the minds of
beasts and even other Gu Masters to be used as a personal army.
Enslavement path is an uncommon one to follow, however, as it costs a
great deal of resources to maintain an army of beasts.</p>
<p>The unorthodox nature of enslavement path requires its own section in
this book; this section will cover using Enslavement Gu, maintaining an
army, and directing them on the battlefield. To follow the enslavement
path, a Gu Master must have a strong soul foundation or else their
results will be very limited.</p>
<h3 id="enslavement-gu">Enslavement Gu</h3>
<p>There are two different Enslavement Gu (not to be confused with Gu of
Enslavement Path): - [Beast] Enslavement Gu exist for pretty much all
wild beasts; in the Southern Border, wolves and boars are a common
target, but some Gu Masters create armies of horses, monkeys, goats, and
even birds. [Beast] Enslavement Gu usually cover a specific animal type;
Wolf Enslavement Gu can enslave wolves, vermillion flame wolves, shark
fin wolves, etc., but they cannot enslave dogs, which are of course
enslaved with a Dog Enslavement Gu. - Slavery Gu is used to enslave
other humans and variant-humans.</p>
<h3 id="controlling-your-army">Controlling Your Army</h3>
<h4 id="individuals">Individuals</h4>
<p>Commanding individual beasts is tedious and quickly drains the soul.
When you individually control a beast, you take its turn for it, and
take 1 damage to your soul at the end of its turn. You can choose to
individually control any beast that is not part of a horde (beast kings
must be individually controlled while part of a horde). If you do not
take an enslaved creature’s turn, it acts like a wild beast and is under
the GM’s command, but will usually follow what the horde is doing and
never attack friendly creatures.</p>
<h4 id="hordes">Hordes</h4>
<p>If you have at least 100 beasts under your control, they must be
separated into <em>Hordes</em>. A Horde of beasts has no minimum amount,
but each must be led by the proper beast king, enslaved by you. The
beast king leading the horde is the <em>Commander</em>. The maximum
number of ordinary beasts in a horde is listed below:</p>
<p>Hundred Beast King: 100 Thousand Beast King: 1,000 Myriad Beast King:
10,000 Beast Emperor: 100,000 Mutated Beast King: 100 Mutated Beasts of
the same type as the <em>Commander</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Beast kings of a lower classification can be included in the
horde of a greater beast king, but can only be controlled
individually.</p></li>
<li><p>Beasts that aren’t part of a horde can only be controlled
individually.</p></li>
<li><p>In combat, creatures enslaved by you act directly after your
turn.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As long as you have at least one beast or Gu Master under your
control and within control range, you gain access to the <em>Direct</em>
<strong>Combat Action</strong>. ### Direct (<em>Combat Action</em>) You
give up to one order to each of your hordes. At the end of your turn,
you take 1d12 damage to your soul for every order given this way.</p>

are brutal, and Blood Path is considered one of the strongest offensive
paths. Hundreds of thousands of inheritances were left by a Rank 7 Gu

shuns the evil and demonic methods of blood path, and many practitioners

<p><em>It’s worth noting that an ordinary human has about 5 liters of

<h3 id="branching-wings-gu-1">Branching Wings Gu</h3>
<p><em>Rank 2 Manifestation</em></p>

<p>Health:</p>
<p>Food:</p>
<p>Keywords:</p>
<p>Effect: 4 huge wooden wings sprout from your back. They each have 25
hit points and vulnerability to rending damage. You gain a flying speed
equal to 2 times the number of wooden wings you have. As a bonus action,
you can quickly sprout a branch from one at a creature within 3 meters.
If the creature is unwilling, make an attack roll. On a hit, the branch
fuses with their spine or sternum, and you carry the creature with you
while flying. Creature’s attached to your wings this way have a +30
penalty to all attack rolls and are <em>restrained</em>.</p>
<p>Branching Wings Gu can carry 1 [<strong>Medium</strong>] or smaller
creatures on each wing. If a wing is destroyed, it falls off your back
and any creature attached to it is freed.</p>
<p>Creatures have to be cut off their branch as a combat action to be
freed (or it can be destroyed as part of an attack, with 1 hit point).
This leaves a wooden cap attached to the body that can be safely cut
away over the course of an hour.</p>
