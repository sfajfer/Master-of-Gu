## $\centerline{Blood Path}$

*Blood path Gu often cost little to feed and are easy to refine, though many recipes require slaughter at huge scales. Its attack methods are brutal, and Blood Path is considered one of the strongest offensive paths. Hundreds of thousands of inheritances were left by a Rank 7 Gu Immortal, Blood Sea Ancestor, all over the Gu world. The righteous path shuns the evil and demonic methods of blood path, and many practitioners live imprisoned in Tie clan's demon suppression tower.*

*It's worth noting that an ordinary human has about 5 liters of blood in their body.*

The fragrance does not cling to creatures that leave the area.
