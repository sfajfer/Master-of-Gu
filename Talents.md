### Combat Absorption
*Cost:* 60 experience
You can multitask on absorbing primeval stones in the heat of combat. Absorbing the essence of primeval stones now takes up your bonus action instead of a combat action.

### Flying Master
*Cost:* 40 experience
Taking flight no longer expends one of your maneuvers per turn. You immediately gain 40 experience that can only be used to improve your **Flying** skill.

### Multitasker
*Cost:* 40 experience
*Can be purchased up to 3 times*
You can sustain an additional Gu every turn without incurring damage to your soul.

### Multi-Weapon Fighting
*Cost:* 20 experience
You can make a number of melee attacks as part of a melee attack combat action as you have wielded weapons, with a +10 penalty to each attack. When wielding only 2 weapons, this penalty is removed.

### Tough
*Cost:* 40 experience
Your base hit points are equal to twice your Fortitude.

### Reactive Flight
*Cost:* 15 experience
As a reaction to being sent *airborne*, you can activate a [**Flying**] Gu and immediately execute a maneuver.

### Weapon Training
*Cost:* 15 experience
*Can be purchased up to 3 times*
When you purchase this talent, pick a class of mundane weapons (swords, spears, bows) or a single Gu.

You gain a -10 bonus on close combat and ranged attack rolls made with the chosen weapon for each time you've purchased this talent and selected that weapon.
If a Gu is very close in form to the chosen weapon, you still get this bonus. This usually includes higher ranked versions of the same Gu.

## Path Attainments
It's difficult to use Gu of a path you aren't familiar with. Every character starts with *Fundamental* attainment in a single path. Oftentimes, a Gu Master that achieves master level attainment in any path gains great fame for their accomplishment, and may be contacted by other forces to refine Gu or complete difficult tasks related to the path.

You cannot purchase a path attainment unless you have purchased all previous attainments in the same path. So you cannot purchase master attainment in a path unless you also have purchased fundamantal and intermediate attainment.

### [] Path Attainment

**Fundamental**
*Cost:* 30 experience
You gain an additional bonus action that can only be used to activate a single [] path Gu on your turn.

**Intermediate**
*Cost:* 50 experience
Your understanding of [] path has reached a qualitative change, and you gain the following benefits:

- You gain a -20 bonus to all **Refinement** and **Knowledge (Gu)** tests to refine or identify [] path Gu.
- **Deduction** tests made to develop killer moves gain a -10 bonus for each [] path Gu in its core.

**Master**
*Cost:* 100 experience
Your understanding of [] path reaches the apex of mortal comprehension. You gain the following benefits:

- You automatically succeed all **Refinement** and **Deduction** tests to refine or improve the recipe of [] path Gu, so long as the Gu is of a lower rank than you. You still have to roll the failure die after a successful refinement.
- You gain a -30 bonus to all **Refinement** and **Knowledge (Gu)** tests to refine or identify [] path Gu.
- You gain a -30 bonus to **Deduction** tests made to improve or create refinement recipes for [] path Gu.
