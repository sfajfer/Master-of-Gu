#### Wan Cheng Peak
Wan Cheng Peak is less than 10 kilometers from Tie Clan, and atop it is built the Demon Suppression Tower. Demon Suppression Tower is a prison hundreds of meters tall and houses thousands of demonic path Gu Masters. It has metal path Gu formations protecting it from attacks. Most prisoners are subdued with the rank 3 Aperture Lock Gu, but rank 4 and even rank 5 Gu Masters are suppressed through an assortment of different methods.

### Tie Clan
*“Our Tie clan, since it was established, had been world-renowned for our bravery, unswerving determination and our iron-cold justice. For many generations, Tie clansmen had been upholding justice and striking down on criminals, in this course, countless people have shed blood and sacrificed their lives. The youths that have died here won’t be the first and also won’t be the last."* - Tie Mu Bai, Ch. 370

Tie Clan stands as a central pillar to the Southern Border righteous path. Their investigators are deployed to solve crimes across the entire continent, and thousands of demonic path Gu Masters guilty of vicious crimes are locked up in Tie Clan's **Demon Suppression Tower** atop Wan Cheng Peak.

## Beasts
There are an uncountable number of different beast species across Southern Border. Some of the more common ones are listed below. Beast statblocks are somewhat different than Gu Master statblocks. Beasts are missing several skills and attributes that they are incapable of using. As they do not have a Perseverance, when beasts reach 0 hit points they immediately die. They also do not have luck points, nor an aperture, and as such cannot activate Gu. Stronger beasts will have wild Gu worms living on or inside of them, however, and these Gu act independently, usually to assist the beast they live within. When the beast is in dire straits, however, most wild Gu will simply leave and try to escape.
