# Cheat Sheet

- **Skill Test:** Roll d100
  - 99 or 100 = Fumble (auto-fail).  
  - <= 1/10 of skill value = Critical (auto-success).
  - Degrees of success/failure: Every 10 above/below skill value.
- **Penalties/Bonuses:** Add/subtract from roll.  
  - +80: Nearly Impossible, 0: Challenging, -60: Trivial.
- **Advantage:** Roll extra td10, take lower tens. Stackable from different sources.

### Opposed Tests

- Both roll skill test; compare degrees of success/failure.
- Critical beats non-critical; fumble loses to non-fumble.
- Tie: Lower roll wins; if still tied, reroll.

## Combat

- **Initiative:** Roll Close Combat (if enemy <= 3m) or Ranged Combat. Most degrees of success acts first. In the case of ties, the lower number on the die goes first.
- **Turn:** 10 seconds.  
  - Actions: 1 Combat Action, 2 Reactions, 1 Bonus Action, Movement.
- **Movement:** Move meters = movement stat. Jumping costs half movement.
- **Flying:** Use Flying skill for maneuvers (Take Flight, Fly, Dive, Evade, Land).
- **Melee Attack:** Roll Close Combat vs enemy in range. Damage = weapon + 1 per 10 Strength.
- **Grapple:** Opposed Athletics. Restrained if you win.
- **Absorb Primeval Stones:** 5 essence per stone, 1 stone per free hand.
- **Hold Action:** Specify action & trigger; use reaction when triggered.
- **Sprint:** Triple movement for turn.

## Reactions

- **Activate Shield Gu:** As reaction to being hit, before damage.
- **Dodge:** Dodge test; When you succeed a Dodge test, you MUST move at least 1 meter and at most 1/2 your movement (rounded down) in any direction. If you are unable to move, you are also unable to take the dodge reaction. If 1/2 of your movement is insufficient to escape an area of effect attack, you are struck by the attack regardless.
- **Parry:** Opposed Close Combat (+10 penalty); counterattack if successful.
- **Detonate Gu:** Instantly destroy any owned/refined Gu.
- **Trigger Held Action:** Use held action when trigger occurs.
- **Opportunity Attack:** Attack creature leaving melee range with melee attack.

- **Burning:** 4 direct heat damage per turn. Remove by water or rolling as a combat action.
- **Ablaze:** 15 direct heat damage per turn. **Perseverence** test at the end of each turn they take damage or fall unconscious. Remove by being submerged.

- **Restrained:** Movement 0, auto-fail Dodge/Flying.
- **Stunned:** No actions or reactions. Is removed at the end of your turn and replaced with *dazed*
- **Prone:** +30 penalty to all skill tests. **Close Combat** tests made to hit a *prone* creature gain a -10 bonus. **Ranged Combat** tests made to hit a *prone* creature gain a +10 penalty. Expend half movement to stand up.
- **Poisoned:** Poison can have any number of effects, and a creature can gain multiple instances of the *poisoned* condition so long as each is unique. 
- **Final Stand:** Can only activate Gu or hold action. Any damage = Dying.
- **Dying:** Unconscious. Perseverance test each turn; 3 Perseverance Tokens (successes) = Final Stand, 3 Predicament Tokens (fails) = Death.
- **Instant Death:** Damage >= 2× max HP from one source.

## Cultivation & Progression

- **Small Realm:** Spend primeval essence to reduce aperture wall health.
- **Large Realm:** Walls regenerate over time. Compare wall recovery to your primeval essence recovery; must be positive to break through.
- **Cultivation Test:** Roll once per hour with {-50, -40, -20, -10, 0} bonus; fail = soul damage equal to degrees of failure (min 1).

## Gu Basics

- **Rank:** 1–5 (higher = rarer, stronger).
- **Activation Cost:** If Gu rank > user, cost ×4 per rank above. If Gu rank < user, cost = 1.
- **Feeding Threshold:** {3 days, 7 days, 30 days, 250 days, 10 years}
- **Refinement:** Roll Refinement test (penalty/bonus by recipe). On success: Roll failure die (1 = fail). On failure: Soul and Gu damaged by (degrees of failure * rank).
